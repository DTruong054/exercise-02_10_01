                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          It began with the forging of the Great
          Rings.

IMAGE: THREE RINGS, each set with a single GEM, are received
by the HIGH ELVES-GALADRIEL, GIL-GALAD and CIRDAN.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
          wisest...fairest of all beings.

IMAGE: SEVEN RINGS held aloft in triumph by the DWARF LORDS.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners
          and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

IMAGE: NINE RINGS clutched tightly by the KINGS OF MEN...as
if holding-close a precious secret.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And Nine...nine rings were gifted to the
          race of Men who, above all else, desire
          power.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          For within these rings was bound the
          strength and will to govern each race.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But they were all of them deceived.

FADE UP: An ancient PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE EARTH...moving
slowly across the MAP as if drawn by an unseen force the
CAMERA closes in on a PLACE NAME...MORDOR.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...for another ring was made.

TEASING SHOTS: SAURON forging the ONE RING in the CHAMBERS of
SAMMATH NAUR.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
          Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged
          in secret a Master Ring to control all
          others.


IMAGE: The ONE RING reflecting FIERY LAVA!   FIRE WRITING
emerges on the plain BAND OF GOLD.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...and into this Ring he poured his
          cruelty, his malice and his will to
          dominate all life.

IMAGE: THE ONE RING falls through SPACE and into flames...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          One Ring to rule them all...

IMAGE: A GREAT SHADOW falls across the MAP...closing in
around the realm of GONDOR...

IMAGE: SCREAMING VILLAGERS, MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, RUN

from their homes, pursued by ARMIES OF HIDEOUS ORCS.

                    GALADRIEL
          One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
          fell to the power of the ring.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But there were some...who resisted.

FADE UP: ISILDUR, son of the KING OF GONDOR, leads an ARMY
ACROSS the PLAINS OF DAGORLAD...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
          against the armies of Mordor.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought
          for the freedom of Middle- Earth.

TEASING SHOTS: THE BATTLE OF DAGORLAD...THE ELF LORD, ELROND,

commands rank after rank of ELVEN ARCHERS...ORCS RETREATING
before the ARMY of the LAST ALLIANCE...ELENDIL holds aloft
the great sword....NARSIL!

                    GALADRIEL
          Victory was near!

IMAGES: THE HUGE, DARK FIGURE OF SARURON, bearing the ONE
RING on his finger, looms over the field of battle...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But the power of the Ring could not be
          undone.

IMAGE: SAURON lays waste to the armies of the LAST ALLIANCE.
With desperate courage, ELENDIL leads a charge...THE BLACK
MACE OF SAURON LASHES OUT!! IMAGE: ELENDIL'S body falls like
a crumpled rag doll... IMAGE: ISILDUR cradles the body of his
father in his arms. The SHADOW OF SAURON falls over him...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
          Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON'S
          ARMOR clatters to the ground. His body

GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The Ring passed to Isildur...who had this
          one chance to destroy evil forever.

IMAGE: GLADDEN FIELD...ISILDUR leads a small column of men
through DARKENING WOODS...the ONE RING glinting on a CHAIN
around his neck.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            But the hearts of Men are easily
            corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
            will of its own.

SUDDENLY!    ARROWS FLY!   They are ambushed by ORCS...ISILDUR
SCREAMS!

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP: ISILDUR MATERIALIZES UNDER WATER...as THE RING slips
slowly from his finger. Ripples of LIGHT play across
ISILDUR'S PALE FACE...he is DEAD.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            It betrayed Isildur to his death.

IMAGE: THE RING falls through the MURKY WATERS of the RIVER
ANDUIN.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And some things that should not have been
            forgotten...were lost.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            History became legend...legend became
            myth.

FADE UP: The waters of the ANDUIN RIVER lie dark and
undisturbed.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            And for two and a half thousand years the
            Ring passed out of all knowledge.

IMAGE: SILT SWIRLS...A THIN WHITE HAND reaches
down...grasping the RING...

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Until, when chance came, it ensnared a
            new bearer!

IMAGE: THE THIN WHITE HAND opens to reveal one ring.

                      GOLLUM (V.O.)
            My Precious...

                                                                5.



IMAGE: MIST SHROUDED MOUNTAINS...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
          took it deep into the tunnels of the
          Misty Mountains.

IMAGE: THE GLOOM of a MOUNTAIN CAVERN..a MURKY POOL of
WATER...in the DARKNESS the SHADOWY OUTLINE of an EMACIATED
FIGURE.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And there, it consumed him. A RASPY VOICE
          mutters in the half light...

                    GOLLUM
          It came to me. My own.     My love...
              (ecstatic whisper)
          My preciousness.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
          cave...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

                       GALADRIEL (V.O.)   (CONT'D)
          It waited.

FADE UP: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the WORLD lies DARK and
STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

SLOW MOTION: unseen by its KEEPER..THE RING falls to the
MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But something happened then the Ring did
          not intend...

                                                                 6.



RING.

                      GALADRIEL
            It was picked up by the most unlikely
            creature imaginable...

                      BILBO
                (to himself)
            What's this?

A YOUNGISH LOOKING BILBO BAGGINS peers down at what lies in
his hand...PERPLEXED by what he has found.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.)
            A Hobbit....Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

                      BILBO
                (surprised)
            A Ring.

SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the

COLD, DANK TUNNELS...

                       GOLLUM (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

WIDE ON: THE CAMERA SOARS AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAINS.      MOVING

FASTER AND FASTER...THEIR DARK GREEN FORESTS AND JAGGED

WHITE PEAKS RECEDING INTO THE SHROUD OF MIST

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.)
            For the time will soon come when Hobbits
            will shape the fortunes of all.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK

                                                          FADE IN:

EXT. HOBBITON WOODS -- DAY

ANGLE ON: TWO HOBBIT FEET

resting on a small rock...rising out of the LONG, OVERGROWN
GRASSES SUPER: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING SUPER: THE
SHIRE....60 YEARS LATER CAMERA TRACKS TO: a Figure lies
beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree.

CONTINUED:

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."

SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. SHIRE LANE -- DAY

The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped
figure in Grey.

INTERCUT WITH; SHOTS OF FRODO RUNNING... CAREERING DOWN A

HILL. . .JUMPING OVER LOGS... DODGING TREE BRANCHES.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO
appears on a bank above the cart.

                    FRODO
          You're late.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...

                    GANDALF
          A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.

They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    FRODO
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.

                    GANDALF
          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
          Bilbo's birthday?

                                                         CUT TO:

                                                              8.



EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by

HOBBITS.

                     FRODO
           What news of the outside world? Tell me
           everything!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     GANDALF
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.

                      GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...

Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.

                     FRODO
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     GANDALF
           Oh, well...that should please him.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              9.

                    FRODO
          Half the Shire's been invited...

                    GANDALF
          Good gracious, me.

                    FRODO
          He's up to something.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.

                    FRODO
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       GANDALF
          Indeed?

                    FRODO
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    GANDALF
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    FRODO
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

                                                       ANGLE ON:

ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. HOBBITON -- DAY

                                                       CRANE UP:

As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           10.
CONTINUED:

The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     CLOSE ON:

Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    FRODO
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.

                    GANDALF
          So am I, dear boy...so am I

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- DAY

Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     BILBO (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    GANDALF
          And what about very old friends?

Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

                     BILBO
          Gandalf?

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins!

                    BILBO
          My dear Gandalf!

Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.

                    GANDALF
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!

Gandalf looks at him more keenly.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.

                    BILBO
          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    BILBO
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?

Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?

Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    GANDALF
          Just tea, thank you.

                       BILBO
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

                    GANDALF
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)

Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.

                    BILBO
          I'm not home.

Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!

                    GANDALF
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the
          arrangements are made.

                    GANDALF
          Frodo suspects something.

                    BILBO
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
          some block headed Bracegirdle from
          Hardbottle!

                    GANDALF
          You will tell him, won't you?

                      BILBO
          Yes, yes.

                    GANDALF
          He's very fond of you.

                    BILBO
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at
          Gandalf sadly...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

                                                      CLOSE ON:

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING

Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

                    BILBO
          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!

Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh,
              (smiles)
          Gandalf my old friend...this will be a
          night to remember!

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT

BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

                    FRODO
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

                     SAM
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

                    FRODO
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

                                                            15.



ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE

as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

                    BILBO
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S

upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.

                    BILBO
          Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!

STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework

                    MERRY
              (urgent whisper)
          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
          FUSE crackles with flame!

Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
              (worried whisper)
          You're supposed to stick it in the
          ground!


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           16.
CONTINUED:


                    PIPPIN
          It is in the ground.

Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!    The fuse
sizzles angrily.

                     MERRY
          Outside!

                    PIPPIN
          It was your idea.

Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!

                    BILBO
          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!

ANGLE ON: FRODO

As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.

ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,

clothes and hair smoking.

                    MERRY
          That was good!

                    PIPPIN
          Let's get another one!

LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!

MERRY AND PIPPIN

Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and
sipping an ale. Cries of "SPEECH! SPEECH" erupt from the
party.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the
applause.

                       FRODO
          Speech!

                    BILBO
              (clearing throat)
          My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
          Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs,
          Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
          Proudfoots...

ANGLE ON: A HOBBIT WITH PARTICULARLY BIG FEET

                       ODO PROUDFOOT
          Proudfeet!

                    BILBO
          Today is my one hundred and eleventh
          birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one
          years is far too short a time to live
          among such excellent and admirable
          Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I don't know half of you half as well as
          I should like; and I like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.

SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I have..things to do and I have put this
          off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S
          knuckles turn white as he tightens his
          grip on the small object behind his back.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I regret to announce, this is the end. I
          am going now. I bid you all a very fond
          farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
          hesitates... then...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (whisper)
          Goodbye.

Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.

ANGLE ON: FRODO

staring at the empty stool in disbelief.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away
as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.

INT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.

                    GANDALF
          I suppose you think that was terribly
          clever?

                    BILBO
          Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their
          faces?




                                                  (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    GANDALF
          There are many magic rings in the world,
          Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.

                    BILBO
          It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're
          probably right as usual.

                    GANDALF
          You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

                    BILBO
          I'm leaving everything to him.

                    GANDALF
          What about this ring of yours?   Is that
          staying too?

Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
          all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

                    GANDALF
          I think you should leave the Ring behind,
          Bilbo. Is that so hard?

                    BILBO
          Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
          I don't feel like parting with it. It's
          mine. I found it. It came to me!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.

                    GANDALF
          There's no need to get angry.

                    BILBO
          Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
          mine. My own, my precious.

                    GANDALF
          Precious? It's been called that before,
          but not by you.

                    BILBO
          So? What business is it of yours what I
          do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.

                    GANDALF
          I think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.

                    BILBO
          You want it for yourself!

Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
          from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
          softens.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
          to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
          Gandalf and hugs him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          All you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. Let
          it go!

                    BILBO
          You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
          to Frodo.

Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo?

                    BILBO
          Hmmm?

          The ring is still in your pocket.

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

                     BILBO
          Oh, yes.

CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.

Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.

                    BILBO
          I've thought up and ending for my
          book..."And he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."

                    GANDALF
          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

                    BILBO
          Goodbye, Gandalf.

                    GANDALF
          Goodbye Bilbo.

Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night,
softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."

CLOSE ON: THE RING...Glinting on the floor...Gandalf circles
around it, a Puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches
for the ring. His fingers barely touch the ring...the creepy
Hum rises on the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of
the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.

          Bilbo! Bilbo!

Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.

                    GANDALF
              (to himself)
          My precious...precious..

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into
          the living room.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          He talked for so long about leaving...I
          didn't think he'd really do it.

                     GANDALF
              (mutters to himself)
          ...my own.

                     FRODO
          Gandalf?

Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's
fingers.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo's ring.

Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
          left you Bag End...

Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into
it.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          ...along with all his possessions.

Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.   He hands it to Frodo.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
          out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.

                    FRODO
          Where are you going?

                    GANDALF
          I have some things I must see to.

                    FRODO
          What things?

                       GANDALF
          Questions.     Questions that need
          answering.

                    FRODO
          You've only just arrived!    I don't
          understand...

Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.

                    GANDALF
          Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
          safe.

Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.

ANGLE ON: THE ENVELOPE

The camera pushes in...the hum of the ring comes up on the

ring...beneath the hum the whispered murmur of BLACK SPEECH

          Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has

          No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
          endured. His life force is bound to the
          ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
          returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
          fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
          land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. For the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
          never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up

          You must take it.

          You cannot offer me this ring.

          I'm giving it to you!

          Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring

          me, it would wield a power too great and
          terrible to imagine.

Gandalf looks at the young Hobbit, moved by his courage.

            My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing
            creatures. You can learn all that there
            is to know about their ways in a month,
            and yet, after a hundred years, they can
            still surprise you.

SUDDENLY!    A SOUND from outside.

            Get down!

GANDALF FREEZES... he moves quietly towards the window, eyes
wide with tension. He raises his staff above the window, and
slams it down on the intruder. THERE IS A YELP OF PAIN!

          You know this? How?

                    SARUMAN

Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone
plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...

                    GANDALF
          A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir.

          wise abandon reason for madness?

At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING!
Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is

              (mumbling)
          It's just something Gandalf said...

                    FRODO
          What did he say?

                    SAM
          He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise
          Gamgee."
              (looks at Frodo intently)
          And I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (laughing)
          Sam...we're still in the Shire...what
          could possibly happen?

SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending
Frodo flying. Frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back
down again by Pippin.

                     PIPPIN
          Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

                    MERRY
          Hello Frodo

Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up... a variety
of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

                    SAM
          What's the meaning of this!

                    MERRY
          Sam, hold this...

Merry gives Sam a large cabbage.

                    SAM
              (accusing)
          You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the
Hedgerow...angry shouts from Farmer Maggot.

                    FARMER MAGGOT    (O.S.)
          Who's that in my field!     Get out of it!
          Get out of my field, you    young varmits!
          I'll show you...get out    of my corn.

Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race
away...with Frodo and Sam on their heels.

                    MERRY
              (looking behind him)
          I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
          a couple of carrots.

                    PIPPIN
          And some cabbages...and those three bags
          of potatoes that we lifted last week.
          And then the mushrooms the week before.

                    MERRY
          Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
          over reacting.

The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!

EXT. WOODED ROAD -- DAY

Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down
a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin,
his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...

                    PIPPIN
          That was close.

Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.

                    MERRY
              (groaning)
          Ow...I think I've broken something.

Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle,
out from his back pocket.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Oh.

                    SAM
              (turning on Merry and Pippin)
          Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

                    MERRY
          What? That was just a detour...a
          shortcut.

                    SAM
          A shortcut to what?

Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of
the road.

                     PIPPIN
              (excited)
          Mushrooms!

CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy
undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are
on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling
down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...

                                                             41.



SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES...

                      FRODO
            I think we should get off the road.

A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some
evil and lonely creature.

                      FRODO (CONT'D)
                (more urgency)
            Get off the road!

Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.

CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...

QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A

BURST OF FLAME.

ANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN

                      SAM
            Frodo?

Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the
ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far
side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken

CONTINUED:


                    MERRY
          What was that?

Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring
lying in the palm of his hand.

EXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.

                      SAM
          Anything?

                      FRODO
          Nothing.

                    PIPPIN
          What is going on?

Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching
intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.

                    MERRY
          The Black rider was looking for
          something...or someone...Frodo?

                      SAM
          Get down!

The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.

                    FRODO
          I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I
          must get to Bree.

Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep
trouble.

                    MERRY
          Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !

The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of
the forest TOWARD THEM!

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          There's another one!! Frodo, this way! !

The Hobbits run   THE RINGWRAITH SHRIEKS!

FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN, are running towards the wide,
placid Brandywine river...and the FERRY.

                    MERRY
          Get the ropes, Sam.

QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES...SNARLING HORSES...

Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and
Tumble onto the Ferry.

                    SAM
              (screaming)
          Frodo!

Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry.

CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!

Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.

                    FRODO
          How far to the nearest crossing?

                    MERRY
          The brandwine bridge...twenty miles.

A thick hedge surrounds the village...a great gate bars the
western entrance.

FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN approaching the gatehouse...wild
eyes, ragged, and out of breath.

                     FRODO
          Come on.

A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them.

                    GATEKEEPER
          What do you want?

                    FRODO
          We're headed for the prancing pony.

The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.

                    GATEKEEPER
          Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
          out of the Shire by your talk. What
          business brings you to Bree?

                    FRODO
          We wish to stay at the inn...our business
          is our own. To Frodo's relief, the
          Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.

                    GATEKEEPER
          All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing
them curiously in the lantern light.

                    GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
          It's my job to ask questions after
          nightfall. There's talk of strange fold
          abroad...can't be too careful.

Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin come rushing in.   Frodo attracts
the INN KEEPERS'S attention.

                       FRODO
          Excuse me.

                     BUTTERBUR
          Good evening, little masters. If you're
          seeking accommodation, we've got some
          nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available,
          Mr...ah...

                    FRODO
          Underhill...my name's Underbill.

                       BUTTERBUR
          Underhill?     Hmmmm.

                    FRODO
          We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can
          you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR
          frowns...

                    BUTTERBUR
              (Puzzled)
          Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh...
              (recognition)
          Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big
          grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with
          relief...Butterbur shakes his head.

                    BUTTERBUR (CONT'D)
          Not seen him for six months. Frodo is
          shocked.

                    SAM
              (worried whisper)
          What do we do now?

INT. PRANCING PONY INN -- NIGHT

Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG
FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam,
Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.

                    FRODO
          Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.

Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.

                    PIPPIN
          What's that?

                    MERRY
          This, my friend, is a pint.

                    PIPPIN
          It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!

Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.

                    SAM
          You've had a whole half already. Merry
          watches Pippin go.

A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at
Frodo, then quickly look away.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (tense)
          That fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.

Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...

                    FRODO
          Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?

                    BUTTERBUR
          He's one of them Rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. What his right name is, I never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          Strider.

                    FRODO
              (to himself)
          Strider.

BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.

                                                            47.



CLOSE ON: FRODO

Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.

"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

                    PIPPIN
          Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
          over there...

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN

sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

                    PIPPIN
              (loudly)
          Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.

Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

                    FRODO
          Pippin!

                    PIPPIN
          Steady on, Frodo!

Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...

                                                      CLOSE ON:

The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

INT. "PRANCING PONY" INN -- NIGHT

Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into
excited babble.

                                        IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

                                                      ANGLE ON:

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.

VOICE OF SAURON

There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately
pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the
real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the
table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY!

                    STRIDER
          A little more caution from you...that is
          no trinket you carry.

                    FRODO
          I carry nothing.

                    STRIDER
          Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
          if I wish, but to disappear entirely...
          that is a rare gift.

                    FRODO
          Who are you?

                    STRIDER
          Are you frightened?

                    FRODO
          Yes.

                    STRIDER
          Not nearly frightened enough. I know
          what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. Strider
          deftly draws his sword.

The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes
a candlestick, and Pippin a chair.

                    SAM
              (angry)
          Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

STRIDER SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his
lips.

          You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
          but that alone won't save you...You can
          no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
          They're coming.

          Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
          deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
          Power. Blinded by their greed they took
          them without question, one by one falling
          into darkness and now they are slaves to
          his will.

Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down
the Bree Streets. CLOSE ON: Strider turns back to the
Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the
Fire.

          They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
          living or dead. At all times they feel
          the presence of the ring...drawn to the
          power of the one..they will never stop
          hunting you.

          You've already had it.

                    PIPPIN
          We've had one, yes...but what about
          Second Breakfast?

Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.

          I don't think he knows about second

Sam rushes forward with a cry. He swings his sword at the
Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword. Sam's
blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...

Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He

Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks
upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...

Orthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very
top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at

close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.

          No. He is passing into the shadow world,
          he will soon become a wraith like them.

A DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air.

          Athelas?

          Kingsfoil.

Galloping Ringwraiths emerge from the trees behind! 2 more

CRANE DOWN: As the White Horse races towards Camera, to
Reveal the wide river Bruinen in the foreground.

Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up
short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white
horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.

                    WITCH KING
          Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws
          her sword and yells at the Witch King.

              (yelling)
          If you want him, come and claim him.

THE WITCH KING SCREECHES ANGRILY, draws his sword, and leads
the Ringwraiths across the Ford. The water starts flowing
faster...a distant rumble can be heard. Arwen waits until
they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle
arms raised!

THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR!

Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing
white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing
cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries
them away! CLOSE ON: FRODO as he loses consciousness...

eyes shut, gasping.

                    FRODO

          here, too. A few more hours and you
          would have been beyond our aid. You have

          I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
          far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. Off home.

                    FRODO
          You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo
          opens his hand, the Ring sits in his
          Palm.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
          ready to go home.

EXT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- DAY

Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony,

                    ELROND
          His strength returns.

                    GANDALF
          That wound will never fully heal. He will
          carry it the rest of his life.

                    ELROND
          And yet to have come so far still bearing
          the Ring...the hobbit has shown
          extraordinary resilience to its evil.

                    GANDALF
          It is a burden he should never have to
          had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

                    ELROND
          Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
          forces are massing in the east. His eye
          is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
          tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
          allies grows thin.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    GANDALF
          His treachery runs deeper than you know.
          By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
          with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
          in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
          can move in Sunlight and cover great
          distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
          the Ring.

Elrond turns and walks away...

                    ELROND
          This evil cannot be concealed by the
          power of the Elves...We do not have the
          strength to fight both Mordor and
          Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay
          here.

Gandalf turns and looks out the window.

Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through
Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
          They must decide how to end it. Not just
          for themselves but for those who come
          after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          The time of the Elves is over. My people
          are leaving these shores. Who will you
          look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
          They hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. They care nothing for the
          troubles of others.

                    GANDALF
          It is in Men that we must place our hope.

                    ELROND
          Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is
          failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          It is because of men    the Ring survives.

FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off
Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was there, Gandalf...I was there three
          thousand years ago when Isildur took the
          ring.

                                                               70.



FLASH INSERT: ISILDUR PICKS UP THE RING AND STARES AT IT,

ENTRANCED.

                       ELROND
             I was there the day the strength of Men
             failed.

             volcano.

                       ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
             I let Isildur into the heart of Mount
             Doom, where the ring was forged: the one
             place it could be destroyed.

FLASH INSERT: ELROND AND ISILDUR STAND BEFORE THE FIRES OF

MT. DOOM.

                       ELROND
             Cast it into the fire...destroy it!

CLOSE ON: ISILDUR...CAPTIVATED BY THE RING.

                         ISILDUR
             No.

Isildur turns and walks away

                         ELROND
             Isildur!!

INT. ENROND'S CHAMBER, RIVERDELL -- DAY

Elrond turns to Gandalf.

                       ELROND
             It should have ended that day, but evil
             was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
             Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
             There's no strength left in the world of
             Men. They're scattered, divided,
             leaderless.

          There is one who could unite them, one
          who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.

                    ELROND
          He turned from that path a long time ago.
          He has chosen exile.

INT. ELROND'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL -- NIGHT

Strider watches from the shadows...as Boromir strolls through
the darkened gallery. Boromir's eyes are drawn to an old
Fresco on the wall...depicting Isildur defeating Sauron.
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of
Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet awe)
          The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut
          the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir
          picks up the sword and gently touches the
          Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood
          appears on Boromir's finger...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Still sharp.

Boromir senses Strider's presence...he looks from the blade
to Strider, as if sensing a connection.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          But no more than a broken heirloom.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          replaces the Broken blade, but it
          clatters to the floor. Boromir walks
          away, leaving Strider sitting alone.

Close on: Strider picks up the broken hilt, as Arwen appears
behind him.

                    ARWEN
          Why do you fear the past? You are
          Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself. You
          are not bound to his fate.

                    STRIDER
          The same blood flows in my veins...the
          same weakness...

Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell... still
and quiet.

EXT. RIVENDELL WATERFALL -- NIGHT

Strider and Arwen stand upon a stone bridge...the Evenstar at
Arwen's breast shines in the moonlight.

                    ARWEN

          Renech I lu I erui govannem?   Do you

          Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen.   I thought
          I had strayed into a dream.

Arwen reaches up and gently touches the Grey at Strider's
temples.

          down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.

                    ARWEN (CONT'D)
          I choose a mortal live.

Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him.

Elrond addresses the council...

                    ELROND
          Strangers from distant lands ... friends
          of old. You have been summoned here to
          answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth
          stands upon the brink of destruction.
          None can escape it. You will unite...or
          you will fall. Each race is bound to this
          fate...this one doom...

Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth,
Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider,
Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth. He
places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat.

                    BOROMIR
              (shocked)
          So it is true!

          The doom of man!

                    BOROMIR
          It is a gift...a gift to the foes of
          Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has
          my father, the Steward of Gondor, held
          the forces of Mordor at bay...by the
          blood of our people are your lands kept
          safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the
          enemy...let us use it against him!

                    STRIDER
          You cannot wield it. None of us can.
          The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it
          has no other master. Boromir turns and
          looks at Strider, coolly.

                    BOROMIR
          And what would a ranger know of this
          matter?

Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...

                    LEGOLAS
          This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
          son of Arathorn. You owe him your
          allegiance.

Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet disbelief)
          Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

                    LEGOLAS
          And heir to the throne of Gondor.

          Gondor needs no king.

                    GANDALF
          Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

                    ELROND
          You have only one choice..the ring must
          be destroyed.

The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.

                    GIMLI
          Then...what are we waiting for?

Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.

                    ELROND
          The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
          of Gloin, by any craft that we

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          here possess. The ring was made in the
          fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
          be unmade. It must be taken deep into
          Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. One of you
          must do this.

Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice

                    BOROMIR
          One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          Orcs. There is evil there that does not
          sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
          It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. It
          is folly.

                    LEGOLAS
          Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
          said? The ring must be destroyed.

                    GIMLI
          And I suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?

                    BOROMIR
          And if we fail, what then? What happens
          when Sauron takes back what is his?

Gimli leaps to his feet!

          erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
          FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow

motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.

                    GIMLI (CONT'D)
              (shouting)
          Never trust an Elf!

CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.

                    GANDALF
          Do you not understand? While we    bicker
          among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!
          No one will escape it. You will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!

CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.

                    FRODO
          I will take it...I will take it...I will
          take the Ring to Mordor.

Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.

          I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
          Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

                    ARAGORN
          If, by my life or death, I can protect
          you, I will.

          And you have my bow.

          And my axe.

Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.

                    BOROMIR
          You carry the fate of us all, little one.

Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          If this is indeed the will of the
          Council, then Gondor will see it done.

Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle
earth stand at his side.

                    SAM
              (unseen)
          Here!

A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

                    ELROND
          No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to
          separate you...even when he is summoned
          to a secret council and you are not.

Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!

                    MERRY
          Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.

                    PIPPIN
          Anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...

ELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP

          Nine companions ... so be it.

          You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"

INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM, RIVERDELL---DAWN

Close on: An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather
Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold
and bright.

                    BILBO
          My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!

Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.

                    FRODO
          It's so light!

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.

Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.

CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (entranced)
          Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
          moves toward him.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I should very much like to hold it again,
          one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
          eyes locked on the ring.

CONTINUED:


Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Oh!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (sad)
          I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
          my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their
left.

                    GANDALF (V.O.)
          We must hold to his course west of the
          misty Mountains for forty days. If our
          luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
          be open to us. From there, our road

          Thanks.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....

                    GIMLI
          If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
          which I note they have not, I would say
          we are taking the long way round.
          Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
          Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
          royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
          that is a bad idea.

                    GANDALF
          No, Gimli. I would not take the road
          through Moria unless I had no other
          choice.

Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.

                    SAM
          What is that?

                    GIMLI
          Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.

                    BOROMIR

          little cover

there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at
Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the
south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.

              (worried)
          Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is
          being watched.

Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing
towards a high mountain pass.

The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     ARAGORN
          Boromir?

                    BOROMIR
          It is a strange fate that we should

Saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside
above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is

luminous silver running through the stone.

              (explaining)
          Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the
          Elvish for friend?

                    GANDALF
          Oh...mellon.

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.

                    GIMLI
          So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          This, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, Balin...and they call this a
          Mine...
              (snorting)
          A mine!

A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           87.

                    BOROMIR
              (grimly)
          This is no mine...it's a tomb!

                    GIMLI
              (in horror)
          Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
          crude arrow out of a skeleton.

                     LEGOLAS
          Goblins!

The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.

                    BOROMIR
          We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should
          never have come here.

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.

                    GANDALF
          Into the mines!

                     BOROMIR
          Legolas!

Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.

A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy
Glow across the old wizards face.

                    GANDALF
              (ominous)
          We now have but one choice...we must face
          the long dark of Moria. Be on your
          guard...there are older and fouler things
          than the Orcs in the deep places of the
          world.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. NEW CHAMBER, MORIA -- NIGHT

WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above
deep mine workings.

                    GANDALF
          Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
          the other side. Let us hope that our
          presence will go unnoticed.

INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT

The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.

                    GANDALF
          I have no memory of this place.

LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.

                    PIPPIN
          Are we lost?

                    MERRY
          No. I don't think we are.   Shhhh,
          Gandalf's thinking.

                    PIPPIN
          Merry!

                    MERRY
          What?

                    PIPPIN
          I'm hungry.

Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.

                    FRO DO
              (whispers)
          There's something down there.

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          It's Gollum.

                    FRODO
          Gollum!

                    GANDALF
          He's been following us for three days.

TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.

                    FRODO
              (disbelieving)
          He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

                    GANDALF
          Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
          Ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. He hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
          Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.

Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

CONTINUED: (2)


                    FRODO
             (grim)
         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

                   GANDALF
         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

                   FRODO
         I wish the ring had never come to me...I
         wish none of this had happened.

                   GANDALF
         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
         scramble to their feet.

                   MERRY
             (relieved)
         He's remembered!

                   GANDALF
         No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)
         Ye s...

                                                               91.



INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...

                    GALADRIEL
          Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
          taps his staff...for a brief moment a
          light

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...

                    GANDALF
          Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.

                    SAM
          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

                    GANDALF
          Gimli!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

                    GIMLI
          No...no...oh, no!

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                      GANDALF
            "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
            Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
            feared.

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...

                      LEGOLAS
                (urgent whisper to Argorn)
            We must move on, we cannot linger.

                      GANDALF
                (reading)
            "They have taken the Bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
            in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
            are coming."

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!

INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY

Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.

                      GANDALF
                (angry)
            Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!

ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...

                       SAM
                (worried)
            Mr. Frodo!

Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!

                     LEGOLAS
          Orcs !

                    ARAGORN
              (to the hobbits)
          Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.

                    BOROMIR
          They have a cave troll!

Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.

                    GIMLI
              (yelling)
          Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
          Moria who still draws breath!

BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.

                    SAM
          I think I'm getting the hang of this.

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.

                     FRODO
          Aragorn!   Aragorn!

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.

                    ARAGORN
              (shocked yell)
          Frodo!!

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

                    SAM
          He's alive!

                    FRODO
          I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

                    ARAGORN
          You should be dead. That spear would've
          skewered a wild boar!

                    GANDALF
          I think there's more to this hobbit than
          meets the eye.

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."

                    GIMLI
          Mithril! You are full of surprises,
          Master Baggins.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.

                    BOROMIR
          What is this new devilry?

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.

                    GANDALF
          Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is
          near.

Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,
spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others:
Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

                    GIMLI
          Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.

INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship run into a hall...the floor is split with
fissures that spit flame.

                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          Over the bridge! Fly!

They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You cannot pass!

                    FRODO
              (alarmed yell)
          Gandalf!

                    GANDALF
              (yelling)
          I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
          wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
          fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.

Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
          at Gandalf with its Sword of

flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and
the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (booming)
          You shall not pass!! The Balrog places
          one foot onto the bridge. Aragorn and
          Boromir race forward, swords drawn.

GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF
STRENGTH!

CONTINUED:

He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips

                    FRODO
              (screaming)
          Gandalf!

                    GANDALF
              (fierce)
          Fly, you fools!

CLOSE ON: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away...
following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss! Frodo cries
out! Boromir scoops him up and carries him away.

                     FRODO
          No!

                     ARAGORN
          Gandalf!

They rush towards an archway.

EXT. DIMROLL DALE DOOR -- DAY

The Fellowship tumble out of the Great Eastern Gate on to a
grassy sunlit hillside. Sam, Merry, and Pippin fall slowly to
the ground, Sobbing...Aragorn turns to Legolas and Gimli.

                    ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Legolas, get them up!

                    BOROMIR
          Give them a moment...for pity's sake!

                    ARAGORN
          By nightfall these hills will be swarming
          with Orcs! We must reach the woods of
          Lothlorien. Come, Boromir, Legolas,
          Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam.

          Boromir glances towards Frodo, then back
          at Aragorn. Frodo is walking away, as if
          in a daze.

                     ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          Frodo?   Frodo!

CLOSE ON: FRODO SLOWLY TURNS...a look of numb shock on his
devastated face. The Fellowship marches on.

EXT. DIMRILL DALE HILLSIDE--DUSK

Aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in
the fading light...in the distance the shimmer of a large
forest can be seen...Lothlorien!

EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLORIEN--DUSK

WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with
yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by
silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks
nervously around...

                    GIMLI
          Stay close, young hobbits..they say a
          Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf-
          witch of terrible power. All who look
          upon her fall under her spell...

Frodo hesitates...a STRANGE VOICE whispers in his head...

                       GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          Frodo...

                    GIMLI
          And are never seen again!

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          ...your coming to us is as the footsteps
          of doom. You bring great evil here,
          Ringbearer.

                       SAM
          Mr. Frodo?

                    GIMLI
          Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare
          so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and
          the ears of a fox!

The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.
Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish
captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain.

                    HALDIR
          The dwarf breathes so loud we could have
          shot him in the dark.

                    ARAGORN
              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your
          help. We need your protection.

                    GIMLI
          Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We
          should go back.

                    HALDIR
          You have entered the realm of the Lady of
          the Wood. You cannot go back.

Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo.

                    HALDIR (CONT'D)
          Come, she is waiting.

EXT. LOTHLORIEN HILLTOP -- DAY

Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.   They look with
wonderment at the vista spread before them.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

                    CELEBORN
          Eight there are, yet nine there were set
          out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
          Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with
          him.

Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
              (softly aloud)
          ...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel
          looks to Aragorn.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The Quest stands upon the edge of a
          knife. Stray but a little and it will
          fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope
          remains while the company is true.

Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go
          now and rest for you are weary with
          sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes
          turn to Frodo...her voice fades.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          Tonight you will sleep in peace.
              (whispered v/o)
          Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... CLOSE ON:
          FRODO looks at GALADRIEL. SUDDEN INSERT:
          GALADRIEL as she is on the other

side... Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a
Piercing white light surrounds her.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...one who has seen the eye.

EXT. CARAS GALADHON LAWN -- NIGHT

Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a
pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on
soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL
SINGING drifts down from the trees above.

                    LEGOLAS
              (sadly)
          A lament for Gandalf...

                    MERRY
          What do they say about him?

                    LEGOLAS
          I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
          the grief is still too near. Boromir is
          sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.

                     ARAGORN
          Take some rest..these borders are well
          protected.

Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.

                    BOROMIR
          I will find no rest here. I heard her
          voice inside my head...she spoke of my
          father and the fall of Gondor, and she
          said to me: "Even now, there

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          is hope left. But I cannot see it...it
          is long since we had any hope.

CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          My father is a noble man, but his rule is
          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          He looks to me to make things right...and
          I would do it, I would see the glory of
          Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
          Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

                    ARAGORN
          I have seen the white city..long ago.

Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes
heart,

                      BOROMIR
            One day our paths will lead us there, and
            the tower guards shall take up the call
             "the Lords of Gondor have returned."

Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet
sadness only when Boromir looks away.

LATER....

The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring
loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the
lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.

                                                          CUT TO:

EXT. GALADRIELS GLADE, LORTHLORIEN -- NIGHT

Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits
a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small
Glade.

                      GALADRIEL
            Will you look into the mirror? Frodo
            looks with apprehension at the silver
            basin.

                      FRODO
                (warily)
            What will I see?

Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a
glow rises from the water.

                      GALADRIEL
            Even the wisest cannot tell for the
            mirror shows many things...things that
            were ..things that are...and some things
            that have not yet come to pass.

Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...

                                                          103.



CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!

FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

                    FRODO
              (joyous)
          Gandalf!

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

                    GALADRIEL
          I know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. It is the future,
          Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.

Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The fellowship is breaking. It has
          already begun. He will try to take the
          ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
          one, it will destroy them all.

                    FRODO (V.O.)
          If you ask it of me, I will give you the
          One Ring.

                    GALADRIEL
          You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
          a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
          Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! Frodo takes a step away from
          Galadriel...

Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
              (gently)
          I pass the test.
              (laughs)
          I will diminish and go into the west and
          remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    FRODO
          I cannot do this alone...

                    GALADRIEL
          You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. This task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

Frodo realizes what her message is.

                    FRODO
          Then I know what I must do. It's
          just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
          kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    GALADRIEL
          Even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.

                    SARUMAN
          Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
          are found. You do not know pain. You do
          not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
          Saruman turns to Lurtz.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
              (coldly)
          One of the Halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN

The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.

                    GALADRIEL
          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY

The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN

The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.

                    ARAGORN
              (quietly)
          Frodo.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          The Argonath...

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

                    ARAGORN
          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          Mordor from the North.

                    GIMLI
              (gloomy)
          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    ARAGORN
          That is our Road...I suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          Master Dwarf.

                    GIMLI
              (indignant)
          Recover my...

Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.

                    LEGOLAS
          We should leave now.

                    ARAGORN
          No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
          must wait for cover of darkness.

                    LEGOLAS
          It is not the Eastern shore that worries
          me.

Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          A shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. Something draws near, I can
          feel it.

CONTINUED:


Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...

                    MERRY
          Where's Frodo?

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....

                    BOROMIR
              (quietly)
          None of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Let me help you. There are other ways,
          Frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    FRODO
          I know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     BOROMIR
          Warning?   Against what?

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    FRODO
          There is no other way.

                    BOROMIR
          I ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          If you would but lend me the ring...

                    FRODO
          No. . .

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

                    BOROMIR
          Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.

                     FRODO
              (wary)
          You are not yourself.

                    BOROMIR
          What chance do you think you have? They
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

Frodo turns to leave.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          You fool! It is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
          me the ring.

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    FRODO DISAPPEARS
          Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    BOROMIR
          I see your mind...you will take the ring
          to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
          your death and the death of us all.

            Boromir stumbles and falls. His body
            shakes as if in the Throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.

                      BOROMIR (CONT'D)
                (Disoriented)
            Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY

                                          IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

                      BOROMIR (O.S.)
            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH)

They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

                                                            111.



AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.

                       ARAGORN
          Frodo?

                     FRODO
              (numb)
          It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
          towards Frodo...

                    ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Where is the ring?

Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.

                       FRODO
          Stay away!

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo...I swore to protect you.

                    FRODO
          Can you protect me from yourself?

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Would you destroy it?

                    ARAGORN
              (kneeling to Frodo)
          I would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of Mordor.

                    FRODO
          I know...Look after the others,
          especially Sam...he will not understand.

Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.

                     ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Go, Frodo!

Frodo hesitates.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (yells)
          Run! Run!!

Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY

Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.

                       SAM
          Mr. Frodo!

Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.

                     LURTZ
          Find the Halflings ... find the
          halflings!

Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.

                    MERRY (O.S.)
              (urgent whisper)
          Frodo!

Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Hide here, quick!

                       PIPPIN
          Come on...

Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...

                    PIPPIN (CONT'D)
          What's he doing?

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.

          He's leaving.

                        PIPPIN
          No!

Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.

                        MERRY
          Pippin!

THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.

                    LEGOLAS
          The horn of Gondor!

                        ARAGORN
          Boromir!

Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...

                        BOROMIR
          Run!   Run!

Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
          Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir!

Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.

                    BOROMIR
              (painful gasp)
          They took the little ones...

              (panicked)
          Frodo...where is Frodo?

                    ARAGORN
          I let Frodo go.

Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.

                    BOROMIR
          Then you did what I could not.   I tried
          to take the ring from him.

                    ARAGORN
          The ring is beyond our reach now.

                    BOROMIR
          Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
          you all.

                    ARAGORN
          No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
          have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
          bind Boromir's wound.

                    BOROMIR
          Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

                    ARAGORN
          I do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but I swear to you... I will not
          let the White City fall, nor your people
          fail...

                    BOROMIR
          Our people...our people...

Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
          lays Boromir down. He is dead.

                    ARAGORN
          Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends
          and Kisses Boromir's forehead.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

                        SAM
           Mr. Frodo!

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

                     FRODO (V.O.)
           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

                     GANDALF (V.O.)
           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

                     SAM
               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself

                        FRODO
           No, Sam.

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    SAM
          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!

                    FRODO
          You can't swim.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       FRODO (CONT'D)
                 (frightened)
          Sam!

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     SAM
          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Come on then..

The two Hobbits row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY

Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    LEGOLAS
          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          You mean not to follow them...

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

                    GIMLI
          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

                    ARAGORN
          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

                       GIMLI
          Yes!   Ha!

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY

Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!

CONTINUED:


                     FRODO
          Mordor!   I hope the others find a safer
          road.

                    SAM
              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.

                    FRODO
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    SAM
          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

                     FRODO
          Sam?

Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're with me.

WIDE ON: THE TWO HOBBITS SETTING OFF TOWARD MORDOR.

                         Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! 
                         [Camera zooms in through the mountain 
                         and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog 
                         on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog 
                         strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming 
                         sword. Gandalf parries the blow with 
                         Glamdring, shattering the Balrog’s sword.] 
                         YOU… SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
 
                         [Gandalf strikes his staff onto the 
                         bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, 
                         the bridge collapses from under it and 
                         the demon plunges backward into the 
                         chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on 
                         his staff and watches the Balrog fall 
                         then turns to follow the others. At 
                         the last minute, the flaming whip lashes 
                         up from the depths of the abyss and 
                         winds around Gandalf’s ankle, dragging 
                         him over the edge. He clings onto the 
                         bridge but is straining to keep his 
                         grip.]

                         him.]

                         grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on 
                         his way down. As they continue to plunge 
                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away 
                         at the Balrog even as it thrashes and 
                         bounces off the walls. They continue 
                         to plunge at great speed, sometimes 
                         with Gandalf clinging to the horn of 
                         the demon. The battling pair then falls 
                         into an enormous cavern and plunges 
                         into the water. Just then Frodo awakens 
                         as if from a nightmare.]

                         terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the 
                         distance at the Mountain of Fire.]

                         Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth 
                         we don’t want to see any closer, and 
                         the one place we’re trying to get to. 
                         It’s just where we can’t get. Let’s 
                         face it, Mr. Frodo, we’re lost. I don’t 
                         think Gandalf meant for us to come this 
                         way.

                         He didn’t mean for a lot of things to 
                         happen, Sam... but they did.
 
                         [Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye 
                         zooming in on him. He gasps and pants 
                         as he backs away.]

                         It’s getting heavier. [Clutches the 
                         Ring by his chest and sits down, still 
                         panting. He then fumbles for his water 
                         bottle and takes a sip.]
 
                                     FRODO

                         Well, let me see. [He takes out a package 
                         of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, 
                         lovely – Lembas bread. And look! [He 
                         digs deeper into his pack] More lembas 
                         bread.
 
                         [Sam shows another package. He then 
                         breaks off a piece and tosses it to 
                         Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]

                         there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you 
                         smell it?
 
                                     FRODO
                         Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] 
                         We’re not alone.

                         Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape 
                         appears on top of the cliff. The creature 
                         Gollum has appeared and is making his 
                         way down to the hobbits.]

                         up, grab hold of Gollum’s arms and pull 
                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum 
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. 
                         As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring 
                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum 
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries 
                         to grab at him but is knocked away. 
                         Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and 
                         tries to reach for the Ring even as 
                         Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push 
                         him away. Gollum’s cheeks puff with 
                         exertion as he struggles with Frodo, 
                         his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. 
                         Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears 
                         him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns 
                         around and bites Sam on the shoulder, 
                         wriggles around and clasps his arms 
                         around Sam’s neck and legs around his 
                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes 
                         Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [menacingly] This is Sting. You’ve seen 
                         it before, haven’t you... Gollum! Release 
                         him or I’ll cut your throat!
 
                         [Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on 
                         Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, 
                         Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum 
                         is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope 
                         around his neck, wailing and writhing 
                         in pain.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty 
                         Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Quiet you!

                         [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum 
                         cries some more and collapses onto his 
                         back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         It’s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor’s 
                         going to hear this racket! Let’s just 
                         tie him up and leave him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         No! That would kill us! Kill us!

                                     SAM
                         It’s no more than you deserve!

                                     FRODO
                         Maybe he does deserve to die, but now 
                         that I see him, I do pity him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         [Begging] We be nice to them if they 
                         be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears 
                         to do what you wants. We swears.
 
                                     FRODO
                         There’s no promise you can make that 
                         I can trust.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         We swears to serve the master of the 
                         preciousss. We swears on... on the precious. 
                         *Gollum. Gollum.*
 
                                     FRODO
                         The Ring is treacherous. It will hold 
                         you to your word.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I don’t believe you! [Gollum backs away, 
                         frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] 
                         Get down! I said, down!
 
                         [Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum 
                         tries to get away from him. He crashes 
                         onto the ground, choking.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Sam!

                         He’s trying to trick us! We let him 
                         go he’ll throttle us in our sleep!
 
                         
                         [Gollum lies panting and holding his 
                         throat. He backs away, frightened, as 
                         Frodo approaches him.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         You know the way to Mordor?

                                     GOLLUM
                         [nods warily] Yes...

                                     FRODO
                         You’ve been there before?

                                     GOLLUM
                         [nods again] Yes...

                         [Frodo reaches out and takes the rope 
                         noose off Gollum’s neck. Gollum seems 
                         surprised and relieved.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         You will lead us to the Black Gate.
 
                         
                         [Gollum scrambles off in the direction 
                         of Morannon and the hobbits follow in 
                         his wake.]
 


                         [A band of Uruk-hai marches across the 
                         plain, with two hobbits bound to the 
                         backs of two Uruk-hai. Pippin tries 
                         to call to Merry, who is unconscious 
                         with a gash on his right brow.]
 
                                     PIPPIN
                         Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]
 
                         
                         [Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand 
                         and signals a stop.]

                         They've picked up our trail! Let's move!
 
                         
                         [The Uruk-hai quicken their pace. Pippin 
                         struggles to reach his Elven brooch 
                         with his teeth. He then tears it off 
                         his cloak and drops it onto the ground. 
                         A foot stomps onto the brooch but it 
                         remains unbroken and visible on the 
                         grass.]
 
                         [Aragorn is lying with his eyes closed 
                         and ear pressed to the ground, listening 
                         for the sound of footsteps.]

                         Their pace has quickened. [He looks 
                         up.] They must have caught our scent. 
                         Hurry! [He runs off.]

                         Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli 
                         and then runs after Aragorn]

                         [pauses in his steps and huffs] Three 
                         days’ and nights’ pursuit. No food. 
                         No rest. And no sign of our quarry but 
                         what bare rock can tell. [Runs after 
                         his companions.]
 
                         [The Three Hunters run across rocks 
                         and plains, with Aragorn in the lead, 
                         followed by Legolas and Gimli. From 
                         time to time, Legolas looks back to 
                         make sure that Gimli is keeping up. 
                         Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick 
                         up an Elven brooch from the ground.]

                         off again]

                         the smoking caverns of Isengard. Saruman

                         huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now 
                         has the strength to stand against the 
                         armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand 
                         against the might of Sauron and Saruman 
                         and the union of the two towers?

                         A new order will rise. We will drive

                         cares for the woods anymore.

                         burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse

                         cry, the Balrog falls from the peak

                         [Gollum pulls them back.]

                                     GOLLUM
                         No! No, no master! They catch you! They 
                         catch you! Don’t take it to him! He 
                         wants the preciousss. Always he’s looking 
                         for it! And the preciousss is wanting 
                         to go back to him. But we mustn’t let 
                         him have it.
 
                         [Frodo tries to make a run for it.]
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] There’s 
                         another way. More secret. A dark way.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Why haven’t you spoken of this before?!
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         Because Master did not ask!

                                     SAM
                         He’s up to something.

                                     FRODO
                         Are you saying there’s another way into 
                         Mordor?
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, 
                         and then… a tunnel.
                          [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate 
                         closes. Gollum is stroking Frodo’s arm 
                         and burying his face in his cloak.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         He’s led us this far, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo, no.

                                     FRODO
                         He’s been true to his word.

                                     SAM
                         [Whispers] No!

                                     FRODO
                         Lead the way, Sméagol.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Good Sméagol always helps.

                         [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares 
                         after him in disbelief.]
 
                         [On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes 
                         into view.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. 
                         There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan, 
                         whose mind is overthrown. Saruman’s 
                         hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
 
                         
                         [In the Hall, Éowyn is kneeling before 
                         Théoden, holding his hand in hers.]
 
                         
                                     ÉOWYN
                         My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? 
                         Uncle?
 
                         [Théoden just sits and stares ahead, 
                         his eyes clouded and unseeing.]
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] 
                         Will you do nothing?
 
                         [Scene returns to Gandalf and company.]

                         Be careful what you say. Do not look 
                         for welcome here.
 
                         [They ride on towards Edoras.]



                         [At Edoras, Éowyn is weeping at the 
                         dead Théodred's bed. She kisses his 
                         hand. Gríma appears at the door.]
 
                         
                                     GRÍMA
                         Oh, he… he must have died sometime in 
                         the night. What a tragedy for the king 
                         to lose his only son and heir.
 
                         [He sits on the bed and puts a hand 
                         on Éowyn’s shoulder.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         I understand his passing is hard to 
                         accept, especially now that your brother 
                         has deserted you.
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         [jumps back and throws off Gríma’s hand] 
                         Leave me alone, snake!
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         [Rises from the bed and moves ever closer 
                         to Éowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who 
                         knows what you have spoken to the darkness. 
                         In bitter watches of the night, when 
                         all your life seems to shrink, the walls 
                         of your bower closing in about you, 
                         like a hutch to trammel some wild thing 
                         in.
 
                         [He puts a hand on her cheek and moves 
                         down to her throat.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         So fair, so cold, like a morning of 
                         pale spring still clinging to winter's 
                         chill.
 
                         [Éowyn and Gríma stare at each other 
                         intently.]
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         Your words are poison!

                         [Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, 
                         she looks away into the distance. A 
                         flag comes off its pole and is carried 
                         by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming 
                         towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the 
                         entrance to Edoras, the flag floats 
                         down to land near him. Edoras is silent 
                         and somber. Everyone is dressed in black 
                         and staring at the newcomers in wary 
                         silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall 
                         and sees a lady in white standing on 
                         the steps. He looks around at more somber 
                         people.]

                         [Aragorn looks up to the hall again 
                         but the lady has disappeared. The company 
                         climbs up the stairs to the hall and 
                         is met by guards.]

                         I cannot allow you before Théoden-King 
                         so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order 
                         of Gríma Wormtongue.
 
                         [Gandalf nods in understanding and signals 
                         for the others to surrender their weapons. 
                         Aragon hands over his sword and knives. 
                         Legolas gives a little twirl to his 
                         knives before handing them over to the 
                         guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]

                         [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.

                                     GANDALF
                         Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You 
                         would not part an old man from his walking 
                         stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.]
 
                         
                         [Háma hesitates for a second and then 
                         gestures that they follow him into the 
                         hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink 
                         and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas’ 
                         arm.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         [Leaning down and whispering to Théoden.] 
                         My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. 
                         He’s a herald of woe.

                         The courtesy of your hall is somewhat 
                         lessened of late, Théoden King.

                         Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey 
                         the hall and its hostile occupants. 
                         A group of men starts to follow their 
                         steps with hostility.]

                                     GRÍMA
                         A just question, my liege. [He walks 
                         towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in 
                         which this conjurer chooses to appear.

                         Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind 
                         you teeth. I have not passed through 
                         fire and death to bandy crooked words 
                         with a witless worm! [Raises his staff 
                         against Gríma.]

                         Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight 
                         as Gandalf continues to approach Théoden. 
                         Gamling tries to go forward but Háma

                         opens his eyes in surprise.] You have 
                         no power here, Gandalf the Grey!

                         and old age accept them and all chance 
                         of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.

                         You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden 
                         of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I 
                         do not think that would be your fate.
 
                         
                         [He bows and Éowyn gazes after him as 
                         he walks away.]
 


                         [The people of Rohan are moving out 
                         of Edoras towards Helm’s Deep, with 
                         Théoden leading the way. At Isengard, 
                         Gríma confers with Saruman, holding 
                         a cloth to his mouth.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         Théoden will not stay at Edoras. It’s 
                         vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect 
                         an attack on the city. They will flee 
                         to Helm’s Deep, the great fortress of 
                         Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take 
                         through the mountains. They will be 
                         slow. They will have women and children 
                         with them.
 
                         [Saruman’s eyebrows rise in response. 
                         He walks through the depths of Isengard 
                         and gives orders to an Orc.]
 
                                     SARUMAN
                         Send out your warg riders.

                         [The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him, 
                         ferocious growls are heard and shadows 
                         dances.]
 


                         [Gollum is trying to catch a fish in 
                         the river. He slips and falls, grasping 
                         at a slippery fish as he goes. Frodo 
                         and Sam follow behind.]

                         Hey Stinker! Don’t go getting too far 
                         ahead!
 
                                     FRODO
                         Why do you do that?

                                     SAM
                         What?

                                     FRODO
                         Call him names; run him down all the 
                         time.
 
                                     SAM
                         Because… because that's what he is, 
                         Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im 
                         but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he 
                         wants. It's all he cares about.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what 
                         it did to him. What it’s still doing 
                         to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] 
                         I want to help him, Sam...
 
                                     SAM
                         Why?

                                     FRODO
                         Because I have to believe he can come 
                         back.
 
                                     SAM
                         You can’t save him, Mr. Frodo.

                                     FRODO
                         [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about 
                         it? Nothing!
 
                         [Sam walks away slowly.]

                                     FRODO
                         [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't 
                         know why I said that.
 
                                     SAM
                         [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his 
                         eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't 
                         take your eyes off it. I've seen you. 
                         You're not eating. You barely sleep. 
                         It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. 
                         You have to fight it!
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Grows angry again] I know what I have 
                         to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to 
                         me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He 
                         walks away]
 
                                     SAM
                         Can’t you hear yourself? Don’t you know 
                         who you sound like?
 
                         [Frodo continues to walk away without 
                         looking back.]

                         Yes, precious. False. They will cheat

                         he goes, preciousss. [He hops around 
                         in joy and does a little dance.] Gone,

                         at Sam. Sméagol raises a fist in self-congratulation 
                         and dances around. He then picks up 
                         one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit's

                         are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat

                         like that! [Holding up the two rabbits]

                         ‘em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips

                         Legolas runs over and kills the warg 
                         with an arrow. He then draws his knife 
                         and kills the Orc.]

                         are under attack!
 
                         [Hearing the alarm, the villagers begin 
                         to cry and panic.]

                         [Gimli gets onto the horse with some 
                         help. Legolas gazes into the distance 
                         and sees many warg-riders coming fast 
                         towards them, kicking up dust trails 
                         as they go.]

                         to Helm’s Deep. And make haste!

                         No! You must do this... for me.

                         [Éowyn holds Théoden’s gaze for a moment 
                         and then turn to attend to the villagers.]

                         I mean, charge forward! March forward! 
                         [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather 
                         unsteadily.] That’s it! Go on!

                         sees Aragorn on Hasufel. They hold each 
                         other’s gaze for a moment before Aragorn 
                         turns to join Théoden. Éowyn departs 
                         with the villagers in the opposite direction.]
 
                         
                         [Legolas takes aim at the distant target 
                         and fells a warg rider. He draws another 
                         arrow and kills another. Just as he 
                         reaches for a third arrow, he sees Théoden 
                         and company approaching. He quickly 
                         runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap 
                         and joins in the fray with Gimli behind 
                         him on horseback.]

                         head on and the battle begins. Théoden 
                         and company hack away at the warg riders. 
                         In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls 
                         off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling 
                         at him.]

                         kills it with one shot.]

                         [As Gimli swings his axe at another 
                         warg, it dies and falls onto Gimli, 
                         pinning him under.]

                         [As he tries to lift the warg off him, 
                         an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills 
                         him quickly, twisting his neck, and 
                         it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at 
                         the Orc and makes a face. He tries to 
                         lift both the warg and Orc off him. 
                         Just then, another warg comes upon him 
                         and bares its teeth, ready to strike.

                         on horseback and throws it at the warg. 
                         It dies, landing on Gimli and adding 
                         to the pile on top of him.]

                         [Théoden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn 
                         is knocked off Hasufel and attacked 
                         by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the 
                         warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt 
                         and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while 
                         the latter is half-dragged by the warg. 
                         In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off 
                         and he rips the Evenstar pendant from 
                         Aragorn’s neck as he falls. Aragorn 
                         tries to let go of the warg but finds 
                         his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. 
                         He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle 
                         himself and is dragged closer and closer 
                         to the edge of a cliff at great speed. 
                         The warg runs right off the cliff and 
                         they both disappear over the edge. The 
                         battle is winding down as the Rohirrim 
                         finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]

                         Evenstar pendant. He takes it, runs 
                         to the edge of the cliff and looks down 
                         to see the great drop and rushing waters 
                         below, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimli 
                         comes to stand beside him.]

                         Sauron with the broken blade of Narsil.]
 
                         
                                     GALADRIEL (V.O.)
                         Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate? 
                         Do we let them stand alone?
 


                         [Scene returns to Henneth Annûn. Faramir 
                         is conferring with his man. They unroll 
                         a map.]

                         What news?

                                     MADRIL
                         Our scouts report Saruman has attacked 
                         Rohan. Théoden’s people have fled to 
                         Helm’s Deep. [Points at the map] But 
                         we must look to our own borders. Faramir, 
                         Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling 
                         an army. Easterlings and Southrons are 
                         passing through the Black Gate.
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         How many?

                                     MADRIL
                         Some thousands. More come every day.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         Who’s covering the river to the north?
 
                         
                                     MADRIL
                         We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but 
                         if the city is attacked, we won’t hold 
                         it.
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks 
                         from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The 
                         fight will come to men on both fronts. 
                         Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us 
                         soon. And he will strike hard. He knows 
                         now we do not have the strength to repel 
                         him.
 
                         [The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds 
                         taken off them by Damrod and another 
                         ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves 
                         in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod 
                         sitting behind them on a rock constantly 
                         watching them. Faramir comes up to them 
                         and sits.].
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

                                     FARAMIR
                         Well if you’re not spies, then who are 
                         you?
 
                         [Frodo and Sam remain silent.]

                                     FARAMIR
                         Speak.

                                     FRODO
                         We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins 
                         is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         Your bodyguard?

                                     SAM
                         His gardener.

                                     FARAMIR
                         And where is your skulking friend? That 
                         gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured 
                         look.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [The merest hesitation.] There was no 
                         other.
 
                         [Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         We set out from Rivendell with seven 
                         companions. One we lost in Mória. Two 
                         were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, 
                         and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son 
                         of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Intently] You’re a friend of Boromir?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Yes... for my part.

                                     FARAMIR
                         It will grieve you then to learn that 
                         he is dead.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Shocked] Dead? How? When?

                                     FARAMIR
                         As one of his companions, I’d hoped 
                         you would tell me. [Pause] He was my 
                         brother.
 


                         [Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought. 
                         Suddenly someone comes up to him.]
 
                         
                                     GONDORIAN RANGER
                         Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found 
                         the third one.
 
                         [Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakens 
                         as Faramir stands before him.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         You must come with me. Now.

                         [Frodo gets up and follow. They come 
                         to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking 
                         the Forbidden Pool.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Pointing down] Down there.

                         [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving 
                         into the water.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         To enter the forbidden pool bears the 
                         penalty of death. [He gestures to archers 
                         hidden in the bushes.] They wait for 
                         my command.
 
                         [The Rangers notch their arrows]

                                     FARAMIR
                         Shall I shoot?

                         [Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges 
                         from the pool onto a rock. He holds 
                         a fish in his hand and starts singing, 
                         slapping the fish on the rock as he 
                         goes.]

                         [singing] The rock and pool is nice 
                         and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish 
                         [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch 
                         a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The 
                         fish almost wriggles out of his grasp 
                         and he whacks it some more.]
 
                         [Faramir has his hand raised to order 
                         his men to shoot. At the last moment, 
                         Frodo calls out.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature 
                         is bound to me. And I to him. He is 
                         our guide. Please, let me go down to 
                         him.
 
                         [Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the 
                         Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum 
                         who is gorging on the raw fish.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Sméagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodo’s 
                         voice.] Master is here. Come, Sméagol. 
                         Trust master. Come!
 
                         [Frodo gestures for Gollum to follow 
                         him.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         We must go now?

                                     FRODO
                         Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow 
                         me, come on. Come. Come, Sméagol. Nice 
                         Sméagol. That’s it. Come on.
 
                         [With the fish between his teeth, Gollum 
                         follows Frodo warily. Suddenly he looks 
                         up in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]

                         head. Frodo stares after them with a 
                         stricken expression as Faramir leads 
                         Gollum and his men away. Back in the 
                         cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground. 
                         Crying, he crawls into a corner and 
                         curls up into ball.]

                         Of course he did. I told you he was 
                         tricksy. I told you he was false.

                         little hobbitses. They stole it from

                         the answer to all the riddles. Here 
                         in the wild I have you. Two halflings 
                         and a host of men at my call. The Ring 
                         of power within my grasp.
 
                         [Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's 
                         neck with the tip of his sword.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, 
                         to show his quality.
 
                         [Frodo is backed up fearfully against 
                         the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo 
                         falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs 
                         the Ring in his hand and jerks himself 
                         away.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         No!! [He runs away from Faramir]

                                     SAM
                         Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you 
                         understand? He’s got to destroy it. 
                         That’s where we’re going. Into Mordor. 
                         To the mountain of fire.
 
                         [Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then 
                         Damrod enters.]
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Osgiliath is under attack. They call 
                         for reinforcements.
 
                                     SAM
                         Please. It’s such a burden. Will you 
                         not help him?
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Captain?

                                     FARAMIR
                         Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to 
                         Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
 
                         [Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]



                         [Aragorn is riding towards Helm’s Deep. 
                         On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai 
                         army marching with great speed. He quickly 
                         makes haste towards Helm’s Deep and 
                         soon sees the refuge.]

                         my friend)
 
                         [He rides into Helm’s Deep to the amazement 
                         of all.]

                         [Pushing his way through the crowd.] 
                         Where is he? Where is he? Get out of 
                         the way. I’m gonna kill him! [He sees 
                         Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the 
                         canniest and the most reckless man I 
                         ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless 
                         you, laddie!

                         Gimli, where is the king?

                         [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn 
                         makes his way in, he runs into Legolas 
                         who stands waiting.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         Le ab-dollen. (You’re late.) [They smile. 
                         Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorn’s 
                         wounds.] You look terrible.
 
                         [To the side, Éowyn sees Aragorn and 
                         smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas 
                         takes Aragorn’s hand and gives the Evenstar 
                         pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar 
                         and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]
 
                         
                                     ARAGORN

                         [Éowyn looks on and smiles even as tears 
                         fill her eyes.]
 
                         [Aragorn is in the keep, conferring 
                         with Théoden]

                         A great host, you say?

                                     ARAGORN
                         All Isengard is emptied

                                     THÉODEN
                         How many?

                                     ARAGORN
                         Ten thousand strong at least.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Ten thousand?!

                                     ARAGORN
                         It is an army bred for a single purpose: 
                         to destroy the world of men. They will 
                         be here by nightfall.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
 
                         
                         [Along the passage behind the Deeping 
                         Wall.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         [to Gamling] I want every man and strong 
                         lad able to bear arms to be ready for 
                         battle by nightfall.
 
                         [Gamling nods and goes off. Théoden 
                         stands at the gate of Helm’s Deep, speaking 
                         to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         We will cover the causeway and the gate 
                         from above. No army has ever breached 
                         the Deeping Wall or set foot inside 
                         the Hornburg.
 
                                     GIMLI
                         This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. 
                         These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick 
                         and their shields broad.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. 
                         I know how to defend my own keep.
 
                         
                         [Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a 
                         hand on Gimli’s shoulder as he follows 
                         Aragorn and Théoden back in.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         They will break upon this fortress like 
                         water on rock. Saruman’s hordes will 
                         pillage and burn, we’ve seen it before. 
                         Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. 
                         Within these walls, we will outlast 
                         them.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         They do not come to destroy Rohan’s 
                         crops or villages. They come to destroy 
                         its people. Down to the last child.
 
                         
                                     THÉODEN
                         [Draws close to Aragorn] What would 
                         you have me do? Look at my men. Their 
                         courage hangs by a thread. If this is 
                         to be our end, then I would have them 
                         make such an end as to be worthy of 
                         remembrance.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Send out riders, my lord. You must call 
                         for aid.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We 
                         are not so lucky in our friends as you. 
                         The old alliances are dead.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Gondor will answer.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold 
                         fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies 
                         closed in around us? Where was Gon… 
                         – No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone. 
                         [He walks away, calling out orders]

                         caves.

                         We need more time to lay provisions 
                         for a siege, lord –

                         [Cutting him off] There is no time. 
                         War is upon us!

                         of carrion crows circle overhead.]

                         carrying Merry and Pippin. He comes 
                         to a clearing and stops.]

                         time. But now something is about to 
                         happen that has not happened for an

                         hear movement from the forest around 
                         them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard 
                         gathering.]

                         if the Ents will go to war.

                         (They have more hope of defending themselves 
                         here than at Edoras.)

                         They cannot win this fight. They are 
                         all going to die!)

                         and then walks away. Legolas makes as 
                         if to go after him.]

                         lad. Let him be.
 


                         [In the hall]

                                     GAMLING
                         Every villager able to wield a sword 
                         has been sent to the armory. My lord?
 
                         
                                     THÉODEN
                         Who am I, Gamling?

                                     GAMLING
                         You are our king, sire.

                                     THÉODEN
                         And do you trust your king?

                                     GAMLING
                         [Puts armour onto Théoden] Your men, 
                         my lord, will follow you to whatever 
                         end.
 
                         [The villagers are handed their weapons. 
                         An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed 
                         boy. Another stares at the axe that 
                         he is handed with frightened eyes. Another 
                         child wearing oversized chain mail takes 
                         up a huge shield. Théoden stands inside 
                         the main hall of the keep, his back 
                         to the entrance where a bright white 
                         light is streaming through.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         To whatever end… Where is the horse 
                         and the rider? Where is the horn that 
                         was blowing? They have passed like rain 
                         on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. 
                         The days have gone down in the west. 
                         Behind the hills, into shadow. How did 
                         it come to this?
 


                         [Everyone is getting ready for war at 
                         the battlements. Aragorn is sitting 
                         on the steps. He sees a young lad in 
                         armour holding a sword looking around 
                         nervously.]

                         Give me your sword. What is your name?
 
                         
                                     HALETH
                         Haleth, son of Háma, my lord. The men 
                         are saying that we will not live out 
                         the night. They say that it is hopeless..
 
                         
                         [Aragorn gives the battered sword a 
                         few swings.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         This is a good sword, Haleth, son of 
                         Háma.
 
                         [He hands the sword back to Haleth and 
                         leans close to him, putting a hand on 
                         his shoulder.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         There is always hope.



                         [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his 
                         battle gear. His sword is handed to 
                         him as he reaches for it. He nods and 
                         accepts the sword from Legolas.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         We have trusted you this far. You have 
                         not led us astray. Forgive me. I was 
                         wrong to despair.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing 
                         to forgive, Legolas.)
 
                         [They smile and clap one another on 
                         the shoulders. They look at Gimli as 
                         he walks up to them, struggling with 
                         his chain mail.]
 
                                     GIMLI
                         If we had more time I’d get this adjusted. 
                         [He drops the bundle and the chain mail 
                         lands with its length right to the floor.] 
                         It’s a little tight across the chest.
 
                         
                         [Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles. 
                         Just then, a horn sounds in the background]
 
                         
                                     LEGOLAS
                         That is no Orc horn. [They run out to 
                         the battlements.]
 
                         [The guards look down in wonderment.]

                         Open the gate!

                         [An army of Lothlórien Elves march up 
                         the Causeway into the Hornburg. They 
                         are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers 
                         look upon them in wonderment and delight 
                         as they pass.]

                         I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. 
                         An alliance once existed between Elves 
                         and men. Long ago we fought and died 
                         together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, 
                         and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
 
                         
                                     ARAGORN
                         [He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome, 
                         Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace. 
                         Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back 
                         lightly.]

                         You are most welcome!

                         [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other 
                         on the shoulder.]

                         [Turning to Théoden] We are proud to 
                         fight alongside men, once more.

                         on the battlements of Helm’s Deep. The 
                         sounds of a marching army move closer 
                         and closer. The women and children in 
                         the caves hear the sounds overhead and 
                         are frightened. Mothers draw their children 
                         close and try to sooth crying babies. 
                         The men and Elves look out into the 
                         darkness, lit by the thousands of torches 
                         carried by the huge advancing Uruk-hai 
                         army and the light bouncing off their 
                         armour. With a row of Elf archers, Gimli 
                         is standing beside Legolas behind a

                         and louder. Lightning flashes and it 
                         begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army 
                         continues to march at the fortress, 
                         an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]

                         their spears furiously.The women and 
                         children in the caves huddle together

                         his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai

                         and hacking through the broken wood.

                         a lance in his shoulder, blocked by 
                         his armour. Grimacing in pain, Théoden

                         Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can 
                         slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer 
                         we are to danger, the farther we are 
                         from harm. It’s the last thing he’ll

                         you’re right. South it is then. Hold 
                         on, little Shirelings. I always like 
                         going south. Somehow it feels like going 
                         down hill.

                         here. But we are. [He stands and leans 
                         against a wall, looking out into the 
                         distance.] It’s like in the great stories, 
                         Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. 
                         Full of darkness and danger they were. 
                         And sometimes you didn’t want to know 
                         the end. Because how could the end be 
                         happy? [Images of the riders winning 
                         the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm’s 
                         Deep] How could the world go back to 
                         the way it was when so much bad had 
                         happened?

                         But in the end, it’s only a passing 
                         thing, this shadow. [The women and children

                         crying tears of relief.] Even darkness 
                         must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard 
                         is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on

                         it will shine out the clearer. Those 
                         were the stories that stayed with you. 
                         That meant something, even if you were 
                         too small to understand why. But I think, 
                         Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. 
                         Folk in those stories had lots of chances 
                         of turning back only they didn’t. They 
                         kept going because they were holding 
                         on to something.

                         What are we holding on to, Sam?

                         Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.

                         is about to begin. All our hopes now

                         hear about Frodo and the Ring.’ And 
                         they’ll say ‘yes, that’s one of my favorite 
                         stories. Frodo was really courageous, 
                         wasn’t he, dad.’ ‘Yes, my boy, the most

                         – Samwise the Brave. I want to hear

SAM looks at the dead, BROWN TWILIGHT, below the LOWERING
CLOUD.

                        SAM (cont'd)
             It must be getting late.

                        FRODO
             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

                        GOLLUM
             Come on, must go, no time ...

                        SAM
             Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

                        GOLLUM
             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.

                        SAM
             Here.

                        FRODO
             What about you?

                        SAM
                  (lying badly)
             I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
             bread.

                        FRODO
             Sam.

                        SAM
                  (confessing)
             Alright. We don't have that much left.

            We have to be careful or we're going to run
            out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
            I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO looksa t SAM questioningly.

                        FRODO
            For what?

                       SAM
            The journey home.

FRODO says nothing.                                            .

EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAY

WIDE: FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the
wining, torturous path ... clambering through BRACKEN and
over JAGGED ROCKS.

                       GOLLUM
            Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
            to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
            Shhh.

EXT. THE FOREST OF ISENGARD. DAY

GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through
dark woodland . . .

The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN ...opens before them . . .
creating an AVENUE of TREES, which allows them access along
the old ISENGARD ROAD. A THICK, HUMID MIST fills the forest.

ISENGARD.

EXT. ISENGARED GATE - DAY

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

                       PIPPIN
             I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon,
             after a hard days work.

                       MERRY
             Only, you've never done a hard days work.

MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

                        GANDALF

ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the
SIGHT before them . . .

                       GIMLI
             You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
             us on, and now we find you feasting and
             smoking.

                        PIPPIN
                  (mouth full)
             We are sitting on a field of victory,
             enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
             The salted pork is particularly good.

                        GIMLI
                  (suddenly interested)
             Salted pork?

                     MERRY
           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.

WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.



                     TREEBEARD
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
           you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

                      GANDALF
           And there Saruman must remain, under your
           guard, Treebeard.

                     GIMLI
           Let's just have his head and be done with
           it.                            .

GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER . . .

                      GANDALF
                (quietly)
           No. He has no power any more.

THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .

                       TREEBEARD
           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER

ANGLE ON: The MUDDY waters GLOWING wit a golden light . . .

ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off his
ho rse an d pi cke d u p -- th e PA LAN TIR !

                 (urgent)
            Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!

PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            Quickly, now!

RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN . . . troubled.

EXT. EDORAS - DAY

WIDE: BACK SHOT - a GROUP OF RIDERS gallop towards the ROHAN
CITY of EDORAS . . .

PUSH IN: EOWYN standing alone outside the GOLDEN HALL,
waiting . . .

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EVENING

WIDE: A ROARING FIRE; a LAMB ROASTING on SPI; LONG TABLES
laden with FOOD; BARRELS of WINE; a banquet is-laid ready for
the returning soldiers.

                       THEODEN
            Tonight we remember those who gave their
            blood to defend this country. Hail the
            victorious dead!

ANGLE ON: Amidst the cheering crowd, EOWYN moves towards
ARAGORN . . . As she proffers the CHALICE their eyes meet.

                       EOWYN
            Westu Aragorn hal.

EOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away . . . a voice speaks in her
ear.

                        THEODEN
             I am happy for you.

EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                       THEODEN (cont'd)
             He is an honourable man.

                        EOWYN
                  (smiling)
             You are both honourable men.

                        THEODEN
             It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
             people to victory.

EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

                       T HE ODE N ( co nt' d)
             Don't listen to me - you are young, and
             tonight is for you.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away.

ANGLE ON: MERRY & PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of the
TABLES . . . both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
                  (singing)
             Oh, you can search - up and down
             As many lands as can be found
             But you'll never find a beer so brown
             As the one we drink in our home town
             You can keep your fancy ales
             You can drink them by the flagon
             But the only brew, for the brave and true,
             Comes from the Green Dragon!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN
steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow.

                    ARAGORN
          No news of Frodo?

                     GANDALF
          No word ... nothing.

                     ARAGORN
          We till have time.

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    ARAGORN (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    GANDALF
          Do we know that?

                     ARAGORN
               (gently)
          What does your heart tell you?

                     GANDALF
               (with a small smile)
          That Frodo is alive.
               (to himself)
          Yes - yes, he is alive.

EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a
stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep.

                     SMEAGOL
          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.

                     SME AGO L (c ont' d)
          No!

             Shhh! Quiet!

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                        SMEAGOL
             They knows, they knows, they suspects us.



SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

             No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty
             Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -

           We must get the Precious. We must get it
           back.

                      GOLLUM
           Patience, patience, my love. First we must
           lead them to her.

                      SMEAGOL
           We lead them to the windy stairs.

           Yes, the stairs ... and then?

           She's always hungry, she always needs to
           feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy
           Orcses.

FRODO grabs SAM'S ARM.

                       FRODO
            Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.

SAM pulls away from FRODO . . .

                       SAM
            I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
            won' t wait around for him to kill us !

                       FRODO
                 (fierce whisper)
            I'm not sending him away.

SAM stares at FRODO . . . at a loss.

                       SAM
            You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!

                       FRODO
                 (lowers voice)
            We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
            without a guide. I need you on my side.

ANGLE ON: SAM, his face softening.

           You must trust me.

FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

                      FRODO (cont'd)
           Come, Smeagol.

GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED
EYES ... and SMILES.

EXT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious
to the CHILL WIND . . . they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to
the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND . .-. DARK CLOUDS mark the sky.

                      LEGOLAS
           The stars are veiled, something stirs in
           the east . . . A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN . . . realisation in his face.

                      LEGOLAS (cont'd)
           The eye of the enemy is moving.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN,

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

           What you doing?

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?

                        PIPPIN
             I just want to look at it. Just one more
             time.

                       MERRY
             Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

                        MERRY
             Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;


ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF

PIPPIN is trembling ... GANDALF calms him . . .

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

                     GANDALF
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

           Understand this . . . things are now in
           motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed
PIPPIN.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be

into TALL WHITE PILLARS ...

ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the
majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS
TIRITH.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD . . . the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR . . .

The figure turns to reveal ... ARAGORN, a little older,
dressed in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE.

is gone . . . she is staring at DARK TREES once more.

ARWEN turns towards her COMPANION who stares at her,

fierce light in her eyes . . .

          You have the gift of foresight - tell me
          what you have seen.

          I looked into your future and I saw death.

          There is also life.                           ,

Her father turns away ...

                     ARWEN (cont'd)
          You saw there was a child . . .
          you saw my son.

He won't look at her . . .

                        ELROND
             Nothing is certain.

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND
sailing through his hair.

                      GANDALF
           We have just passed into the realm of
           Condor!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . .

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

                     GANDALF
          Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the
CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost
walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . .

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

                         PIPPIN                             ;

             Gandalf! Gandalf!

                       GANDALF
             Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
             the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        GANDALF
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

                         DENETHOR
                  (bitter)
             Perhaps you come to explain this?

             Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
             me . . . he fell, defending us from many
             foes.

CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.

                  (hurried whisper)
             Pippin!

PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD . . .

                        PIPPIN
             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         GANDALF
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!

             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

                (contemptuous)
           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
           of Lordship.

                       GANDALF

            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      GANDALF
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     PIPPIN
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . I mean, they don't actually

GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.



                     GANDALF
          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      PIPPIN
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape

self-deprecating smile . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Just a fool's hope.

like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.

           it.

FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, NEAR-

                  (disorientated)

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,

FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against
their ears, as out of the CITY comes a RENDING SCREECH . . .
SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the

a long sickening WAIL, to SILENCE.

ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD . . . across the NARROW
VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGUL
- the WITCH KING - suddenly RISES UP out of the DEAD CITY on

                        GANDALF V/0
             This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
             the west through many ages . . . It is a
             hatred that flows from the depths of time,
             across the deeps of the Sea.

The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his

riding toward MINAS TIRITH . . . in the SKY above DARK SHAPES
pursue them ...

ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, from on HIGH, the NAZGUL strike!

TILT DOWN ... following the NAZGUL as it SWOOPS out of LOW-
LYING, MURKY CLOUDS tossing MEN in the AIR like LIMP RAG-DOLLS!

AT THAT MOMENT: Across the PLAIN, a FIGURE clothed in WHITE
rides towards them!

From the BATTLEMENTS of MINAS TIRITH, a call . . . "The White
Rider!"

EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DAY

WIDE ON: GANDALF as he spurs SHADOWFAX forward! PIPPIN clings
tightly to the great horses MANE.

ANGLE ON: FARAMIR, SWORD in hand, remains at the REAR, trying
desperately to fend off the DEADLY ASSAULT . . .

AGAIN the FELL-BEASTS DIVE low ...

GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF ...

A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards! The NAZGUL
SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD!

For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto
PELENNOR FIELDS . . . The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS,
swiftly spiralling higher and higher.

The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards the
safety of MINAS TIRITH.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH GATES - DAY

ANGLE ON: IORLAS runs towards the GATES, yelling . . .

                     IORLAS
          Open the Gates! Pull!

The GREAT GATES OPEN, allowing GANDALF, PIPPIN, FARAMIR and
the OSGILIATH SURVIVORS to RIDE IN . . . Nearly 100 WOUNDED AND
SHOCKED MEN.

AS GANDALF pulls SHADOWFAX up . . .

                        FARAMIR
             Mithrandir!

ANGLE ON: FARAMIR STEERS HIS HORSE through the CROWD towards
GANDALF ...

                        FARAMIR   (cont'd)
             They broke through    our defences. They have
             taken the bridge a   nd the West Bank.
             Battalions of Ores    are crossing the River.

                        IORLAS
             It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long
             has he foreseen this doom!

                        GANDALF
             Foreseen and done nothing!

FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise
in his eyes.

                       GA ND ALF (c on t'd )
             Faramir? ... This is not the first halfling
             to have crossed your path ...

FARAMIR shakes his head.

                       FARAMIR
             No.

                        PIPPIN
                  (disbelief)
             You've seen Frodo and Sam?

FARAMIR NODS.

            Vale.

                       GANDALF
                 (shocked realisation)
            . . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF, deeply troubled.

                       PIPPIN
            What does that mean? What's wrong?

                        GANDALF

            Faramir . . . Tell me everything.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.
They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER ·
their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                      GOLLUM
            Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
            fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE . . . he has reached a
SMALL LEDGE.

                      GOLLUM
           Come, Master.

CLOSE ON: FRODO tries to CLAMBER UP onto the LEDGE . . . as he
does, the RING slips out of his SHIRT and DANGLES in FULL
VIEW of GOLLUM!

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM rears back in shock . . . tenses like a CAT,
EYES WIDENING.

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
                  (dreamlike)
             Come to Smeagol.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. He
doesn't notice GOLLUM'S HAND reaching for the RING !

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S FINGERS . . . closing in on the RING   ...

ANGLE ON: SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS
DRAWS HIS SWORD!

                        SAM
                  (alarmed yell)
             Mr Frodo!

STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the
process . . .

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Get back, you. Don't touch him!

ANGLE ON: SAM'S horrified face as . . .

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM
pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

                       GOLLUM
             Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
             Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with
their heavy pale lids.

           cannot know. Smeagol look after Master.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM creeps CLOSE to FRODO and WHISPERS in his
ear:

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
                  (rasping whisper)
           He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it
           in   his eye. Very soon he will ask you for
           it   - you will see . . . the Fat One will take
           it   from you.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looking at SAM . . . his hand strays to his
NECK, closing tight around the RING.

             I do not think we should so lightly abandon
             the outer defences; defences that your
             brother long held intact.

                        FARAMIR
             What would you have me do?

                       DENETHOR
             I will not yield the River and Pelennor
             unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.

                        FARAMIR
             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                        DENETHOR
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a
             Captain here who still has the courage to
             do his Lord's will?

CLOSE ON: FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth.

                  (quietly)
             You wish now that our places had been

            Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
            what I can in his stead.

AERIAL SHOT: . . . HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE
next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM.

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over

                  (prevaricating)
             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
             yes, my Precious, very nice.

                        SAM
             Alright, alright - you just startled me is

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

                        SAM
             Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            -

                 (confused)
            I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to
            help!

FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening
intense ENERGY.

                       GOLLUM
            See! See! He wants it for himself.

                       SAM
                 (beside himself)
            Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.

            No, Sam . . . it's you.

            But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you
            against me.

                       FRODO
            You can't help me anymore.

                       SAM
            You don't mean that.

                     FARAMIR
               (deadened)
          Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

GANDALF reads the PAIN in FARAMIR'S eyes . . . he calls after
him, trying one more time to stop the YOUNG MAN.

                     GANDALF
          Your father loves you, Faramir!

INT. TOWER HALL, MINAS TIRITH - DAY

FAST PUSH IN . . . to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats.

                      DENETHOR
           Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

                      PIPPIN
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
           sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                      PIPPIN V/0
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
           Until the stars are all alight.
           Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
           All shall fade, all shall fade.

             I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
             my Lord.

                        ROHAN MARSHALL (0.S.)
             We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
             Theoden, King.

THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on.

                        DENETHOR
                  (quietly)
             Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

             None have come, My Lord.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

ARAGORN joins THEODEN on a BLUFF overlooking the ENCAMPMENT
BELOW ...

CAMERA CRANES to REVEAL: THOUSANDS of MEN and HORSES! Smoke

TWILIGHT HAZE.

                         THEODEN
                  (quietly)
             Six thousand spears . . . less than half of
             what I had hoped for . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN ...

                       ARAGORN
             Six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of Mordor.

                     THEODEN
          More will come.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN realising what ARAGORN is saying - no

THEODEN nods.

The HORSES whinny loudly in the distance ... THEODEN looks up
at the MOUNTAIN which looms behind them . . .

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

ANGLE ON: HORSES rearing in terror as ROHAN SOLDIERS try to
quieten them ...

ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS and GIMLI move through the CAMP . . .

CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS looking at a group of ROHAN SOLDIERS . . .
they sit quiet and hunched ... no-one speaking ...

LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE ...

                        LEGOLAS
                  (uneasy)
             The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;.

             They grow nervous in the shadow of the
             mountain . . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                       GIMLI
             That road there - where does that lead?

                       LEGOLAS
             It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door
             under the mountain.

             That mountain is evil . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands before the road as though transfixed
... before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes
nervously . . .

STRAP.

                        EOWYN
             There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD ...

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

                        MERRY
             Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.

As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are

                        EOWYN
             To the Smithy .- go!

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.

                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.

                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

             I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers ...
At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND

ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and
LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes ...

CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD . . . to

             She will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       ARAGORN
             It will not be our end, but his.

                         ELROND
             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the

FLASH INSERT: A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER
RIBBON of WATER .

             They will be in the city in two days . . .
             You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
             men.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS . . .

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE . . . The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . . .

                    ARAGORN
          Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? They believe in nothing.
          They answer to no-one.

                     ELROND
          They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

CLOSE ON: ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a
SWORD from the scabbard to reveal . . . a ELVEN SWORD glints in

          Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of

            sword can summon to him an army more deadly
            than any that walks this earth.

ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN . . .

                      ELROND (cont'd)
            Put aside the Ranger - become who you were
            born to be - take the Dimhplt Road.

A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN re-sheathes the SWORD.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: As ARAGORN readies BREGO for leaving EOWYN
approaches ... her temper barely held in check.

                       EOWYN
            Why are you doing this?

ARAGORN looks over his shoulder at her . . .

                      EOWYN (cont'd)
            The war lies to.the East. You cannot leave
            on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon         ;
            the men.

                          ARAGORN
            Eowyn . . .

ARAGORN rounds on her ...

                       ARAGORN
             Why have you come?

                  (hesitant)
             Do you not know?

ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

                        ARAGORN
                  (gentle)
             It is but a shadow and a thought that you
             love . . . I cannot give you what you seek.

EOWYN steps back at though STRUCK . . . she watches stricken as
ARAGORN leaves . . .

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU'- NIGHT

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads his horse through the TENTS towards
the DIMHOLT ROAD.

A LIGHT FLARES ahead.of him . . .

ANGLE ON: A SHORT FIGURE steps out of the SHADOWS . . . PIPE in
hand.

                        GIMLI
             And just where do you think you're off to?

ARAGORN looks at GIMLI - GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but
determined to go ALONE.

                        ARAGORN
             Not this time ... This time you must stay,
             my friend.

                        LEGOLAS O.S
             Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
             of Dwarves?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS as he appears, leading his
HORSE - already SADDLED.

             You might as well accept it - we're going
             with you, laddie.

ARAGORN shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI ... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from
their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the
MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves,
"What's happening?", "Where's he going?"

                    GAMLING
          Lord Aragorn!

                    ROHAN SOLDIER O.S.
          Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

                    GAMLING
          He leaves because there is no hope.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN as he moves forward.

                    THEODEN
          He leaves because he must.

                     GAMLING
          Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
          armies of Mordor.

                      THEODEN
          No, we cannot . . .
               (surveying his frightened Men)
          But we will meet them in battle,
          nonetheless.

EXT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN

ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks at EOWYN who stands as if turned to
stone ... she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY ... The QUIET
before the MEN depart for WAR . . .

                      THEODEN
                (gentle)
           I have left instruction: the people are to
           follow your rule in my stead ... take up my
           seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you
           defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN turns to the KING ... her FACE a BLANK ...
She speaks without emotion.

                      EOWYN
           What other duty would you have me do, my
           Lord?

THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND . . .

                     THEODEN
               (quiet)
           Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again -
           not grieve for those whose time has come.

EOWYN slowly lifts her head . . .

                     THEODEN (cont'd)
           You shall live to see these days renewed.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN lifts EOWYN faces to look into her EYES . . .

                        GIMLI
             What kind of an army would linger in such a
             place?

                       LEGOLAS
             One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
             the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
             of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
             but when the time came, when Condor's need
             was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
             darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
             cursed them - never to rest until they had
             fulfilled their pledge.

SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES.                                     '

EXT. DIMHOLT GLEN - DAY

ANGLE ON: Before them, at the ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN, a SHEER
WALL of ROCK towers . . .

                     GIMLI
               (terrified whisper)
          The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

                     LEGOLAS
               (translating)
          The way is shut. It was made by those who
          are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
          shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
. . . ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY.

                       ARAGORN

             I do not fear death ...

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN WALKING into the BLACKNESS.

LEGOLAS quickly follows . . . swallowed by the DARKNESS.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE . . . He hesitates, struggling with hi
FEAR.

                         GIMLI
             Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf
             will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.
                  (gritting his teeth)
             Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!

GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!

ANGLE ON: THEODEN strides through the CAMP, EOMER at his SIDE.

                     THEODEN
          We must ride light and swift. It's a long
          road ahead ... and man and beast must reach
          the end with the strength to fight.

ANGLE ON: MERRY . . . preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and
SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING . . . he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

                        THEODEN
             It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
             None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

             But . . . I want to fight!

                        THEODEN
             I will say no more.

KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away . . .

MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by . . . a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS.

SUDDENLY . . . MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has
snatched him by the collar ... and plonked him down on their
SADDLE!

CLOSE ON: MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER . . .
Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is . . .

SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!

CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS

SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!

She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT
SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

SHELOB SPASMS . . . a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!

to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!

TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

BLADE of STING as it hacks through the FIBROUS STRANDS. They
whip and snap back into FRODO'S FACE as he cuts himself free.

ANGLE ON: Back up the TUNNEL - lit by the LIGHT OF GALADRIEL -
SHELOB'S HEAVING SHADOW approaches . . .

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM watches in mounting disbelief as STING
slashes through the WEB ... DISBELIEF turns to FEAR as SHELOB
gets closer and closer, GOLLUM quickly turns and BOLTS::.. . . .

FRODO hacks at the WEB and with a last desperate LUNGE, frees
himself ... STING is caught in the WEB ... FRODO leaves the
SWORD and THROWS HIMSELF through a narrow CREVICE . . .

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - DAY

ANGLE ON: FRODO stumbles out of SHELOB'S LAIR . . . Tumbling
onto COLD ROCK.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S
THROAT.

                        SMEAGOL (cont'd)
             Smeagol promised. You must believe us. It
             was the Precious - the Precious made us to
             do it.

FRODO has a sudden moment of SELF REALISATION and releases
GOLLUM, horrified at his VIOLENCE.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM cowering back . . . COUGHING and SPLUTTERING.

ANGLE ON: FRODO looking at SMEAGOL, in SHOCK, he gets to his
FEET.

             I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to
             destroy it for both our sakes.

SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF . . . in a FURY he LUNGES
at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge
of the PRECIPICE - GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and FALLS
to the bottom of the RAVINE ...

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT

FRODO, overcome with EXHAUSTION, stumbles down the steep
stairs of CIRITH UNGOL . . . He is full of REMORSE at his
TREATMENT of SAM ...

                         FRODO

wanting to lie down . . . But he knows what he must do.

ANGLE ON: An IRON DOOR creaks OPEN . . . FARAMIR'S PROCESSION
enters a WIDE VAULTED CHAMBER.

The LANTERN LIG HT throws great SHADOWS upon the SHROUDED
WALLS of a wide  VAULTED CHAMBER. ROW upon ROW of MARBLE TOMBS
are visible in  the DIM LIGHT. Upon each TOMB lies a SLEEPING
FORM, carved in  STONE, hands folded.

DENETHOR speaks in a HUSHED VOICE . . .

                       DENETHOR
                (whisper)
           No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long
           slow sleep of death embalmed . . . we shall
           burn - like the heathen kings of old!

The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE
TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed
. . . as MOURNERS beside a bed of death.

DENETHOR turns to his SERVANTS.

SPINS AROUND: Before he can react, SHELOB VICIOUSLY STABS
FRODO in the NECK with her monstrous abdominal STINGER!

With HIND LEGS, SHELOB picks SAM off the ground and TOSSES
him BACKWARDS! SAM lands heavily . . . and SHELOB POUNCES!

ANGLE ON: SHELOB heaves the great bag of her BELLY high above
SAM'S HEAD. As she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk
down on him, SAM lifts the ELVEN BLADE above his head,
holding it with TWO HANDS.

STING slides into SHELOB'S SOFT UNDERBELLY! A SHUDDER runs
through her! HEAVING up. again, she wrenches herself away from
the PAIN ... her LIMBS writhing beneath her.

LOW CLOUDS!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI and PIPPIN watch as . . .
ARAGORN walks slowly across the FIELD OF BATTLE towards the
HIDEOUS GHOULS ...

                       GIMLI
                 (quietly)
            Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these
            lads - despite the fact, they're dead!

                      KING OF THE DEAD
            You gave us your word.

PIPPIN, in his GONDORIAN armour, looks around at the

fix on something.

TILT UP . . . to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and

ANGLE ON . . . FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED

CIRITH UNGOL ... into MORDOR.

CLOSE ON: FRODO and SAM . . . they STOP DEAD . . . STARING AHEAD:

ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM . . . 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren
GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .

. . . TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM ...

                      SAM
           We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

ANGLE ON: FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of
FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands
upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there .

           There are so many of them . . . So many.
           We'll never get through unseen.

THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE ... BARAD-DUR

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

                       SAM
             We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
             nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
             down the hill for starters.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY

CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL . . . seemingly
alone . . . he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

                        GANDALF
             Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
             darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN . . .

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF . . .

                       ARAGORN
             If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF - still troubled, still worried . . .

                    GANDALF
          It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
          a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
          Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD . . .

                    GIMLI
          Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
          we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF . . . His face ashen.

                    GANDALF
          Because ten thousand Ores now stand between
          Frodo and Mount Doom.

                        ARAGORN
             No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .

                       ARAGORN (cont'd)
             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of
             Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

                        GANDALF
             How?

                        ARAGORN
             Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
             Then we gather our full strength and march
             on the Black Gate.

At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe . . . EOMER steps forward.

                        EOMER
             We cannot achieve victory from strength of
             arms .

                        ARAGORN
             Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo
             his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed
             upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
             moves .

                  (doubtful)
             Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
             take the bait!

LANDSCAPE ... they are no longer WEARING the ORC ARMOUR.

CLOSE ON: FRODO is walking half-bowed, often stumbling . . . as
if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST ... supporting a
HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off
some invisible blow. SAM watches him, CONCERN etched across
his FACE . . .

CLOSE ON: FRODO as a malevolent VOICE in his head calls to
him . . . "Baggins - Baggins" . . .

From behind the HUGE GATES, the terrifying CHANTING and the

             No, Sam. I can't recall    the taste of food;

                  (ELVISH: with subtitles)
             I Aear can ven na mar.

             T he Sea calls us ho me.


ELROND holds out his ARMS to BILBO who suddenly seems MUCH
YOUNGER and SPRIGHTLIER . . . He sets off down the PATH TOWARD
his HOSTS . . .

                        BILBO
             I think I'm quite ready for another
             adventure.

BILBO walks down toward the BOAT and BOARDS with ELROND . . .

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up . . . GALADRIEL is watching him. She
SMILES, TURNS and BOARDS the BOAT . . .

GANDALF kneels before SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN - who are all
looking TEARFUL.

                       GANDALF
             Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
             finished. Here at last, on the shores of
             the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

There is GREAT SADNESS . . . MERRY SNIFFLES LOUDLY.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
             tears are an evil.

CONTINUED: (2)


CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns and walks away . . . FRODO is DOWNCAST
... SUDDENLY, GANDALF turns and looks toward him.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           It is time, Frodo.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks
towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

                      SAM
                (alarmed)
           What does he mean?

CLOSE ON: FRODO turns to SAM. . . .

                       FRODO
                (gently)
           We set out to save the Shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

                       SAM
                (shaken)
           You don't mean that - you can't leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks down . . . FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED
JOURNAL out towards him.

                      FRODO
           The last pages are for you, Sam.

SAM is SOBBING . . . MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT . . . .

FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM . . . and
climbs on board the SHIP.

ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face . . . as
he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP
glides away from the DOCK ...

WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS,
disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: ( 3 )


ANGLE ON: SAM in growing darkness, still follows the
departing SHIP with his eyes, MERRY and PIPPIN are already
preparing to leave.

                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. NO.3 BAGSHOT ROW - MORNING

ANGLE ON: SAM walks up the path towards his house . . .

A LITTLE GIRL toddles up to greet him.

                       SAM
            Elanor!

He hugs his daughter . . .

                       FRODO V/0
            My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
            two. You have to be one and whole for many
            years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
            to do. Because Sam, your part in the
            journey goes on.

ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON steps up and kisses SAM on the cheek
. . . she gives him a TINY BABY BOY to cradle.

                       SAM
            Hello, little Frodo!

ANGLE ON: SAM with his FAMILY . . . he draws a deep breath:

                      SAM (cont'd)
           Well ... I'm back.

SAM looks at his LOVELY FAMILY with GREAT HAPPINESS, tinged
with a little SADNESS . . .

SAM and ROSIE take the CHILDREN'S HANDS and enter BAGSHOT . . .
the BRIGHT YELLOW DOORWAY closes behind them.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.

                        THE END.




My dear Frodo:
You asked me once...
...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.
And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...
...I may not have told you all of it.
I am old now, Frodo.
I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.
I think it is time for you to know...
...what really happened.
It began long ago...
...in a land far away to the east...
...the like of which you will not find
in the world today.
There was the city of Dale.
Its markets known far and wide.
Full of the bounties of vine and vale.
Peaceful and prosperous.
For this city lay before the doors
of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:
Erebor.
Stronghold of Thror,
King Under the Mountain.
Mightiest of the Dwarf Lords.
Thror ruled with utter surety...
...never doubting his house would endure...
...for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son...
...and grandson.
Ah, Frodo. Erebor.
Built deep within the mountain itself...
...the beauty of this
fortress city was legend.
Its wealth lay in the earth...
...in precious gems hewn from rock...
...and in great seams of gold...
...running like rivers through stone.
The skill of the Dwarves was unequaled...
...fashioning objects of great beauty...
...out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.
Ever they delved deeper,
down into the dark.
And that is where they found it.
The Heart of the Mountain.
The Arkenstone.
Thror named it "The King's Jewel."
He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule was divine.
All would pay homage to him.
Even the great Elven King, Thranduil.
But the years of peace and plenty
were not to last.
Slowly the days turned sour...
...and the watchful nights closed in.
Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce.
A sickness had begun to grow within him.
It was a sickness of the mind.
And where sickness thrives...
...bad things will follow.
The first they heard
was a noise like a hurricane...
...coming down from the North.
The pines on the mountain
creaked and cracked in the hot, dry wind.
Balin, sound the alarm.
Call out the guard. Do it now!
What is it?
Dragon.
Dragon!
He was a firedrake from the North.
Smaug had come.
Such wanton death was dealt that day.
For this city of Men was nothing to Smaug.
His eye was set on another prize.
For dragons covet gold
with a dark and fierce desire.
Aah!
No!
Come on.
Erebor was lost.
For a dragon will guard his plunder...
...as long as he lives.
Run for your lives!
Ah! Help us!
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his
kin against the wrath of the dragon.
No help came from the Elves that day...
...nor any day since.
Robbed of their homeland...
- -the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...
...a once mighty people brought low.
The young Dwarf prince took work
where he could find it...
...laboring in the villages of Men.
But always he remembered...
...the mountain smoke beneath the moon...
...the trees like torches blazing bright.
For he had seen dragon fire in the sky...
...and a city turned to ash.
And he never forgave...
...and he never forgot.
That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in.
For, quite by chance,
and the will of a Wizard...
...fate decided I would become
part of this tale.
It began...
Well, it began as you might expect.
In a hole in the ground...
...there lived a Hobbit.
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.
This was a Hobbit hole.
And that means good food, a warm hearth...
...and all the comforts of home.
Thank you.
What's this?
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off.
It's not ready yet.
Not ready for what?
Reading.
What on earth are these?
Replies to the party invitations.
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?
They all say they're coming.
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses,
who are demanding you ask them in person.
Are they, indeed? Over my dead body.
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.
They seem to think you have tunnels...
- ...overflowing with gold.
- It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.
And it still smells of Troll.
What on earth are you doing?
Taking precautions.
You know, I caught her making off
with the silverware once.
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!
Dreadful woman.
Make sure you keep an eye on her
after I'm...
When I'm... When I'm...
When you're what?
It's nothing. Nothing.
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.
Odd? Oh. Hm.
Unsociable.
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.
- Do you think he'll come?
- Who?
Gandalf.
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers.
He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.
- Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?
East-farthing Woods.
I'm going to surprise him.
Well, go on, then.
You don't want to be late.
He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no.
Not that I ever was.
In those days, I was always on time.
I was entirely respectable.
And nothing unexpected...
...ever happened.
- Good morning.
- What do you mean?
Do you wish me a good morning...
...or do you mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not?
Or perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular morning?
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?
All of them at once, I suppose.
Hmm.
Can I help you?
That remains to be seen.
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.
An adventure?
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.
Mm. Huh.
Hmm.
Oh. Ah.
Good morning.
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.
Beg Your pardon?
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.
I'm Gandalf.
And Gandalf means...
...me.
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...
...who made such excellent fireworks?
Old Took used to have them on
Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.
No idea you were still in business.
And where else should I be?
Where else...? Ahem.
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember
something about me...
...even if it's only my fireworks.
Yes. Well, that's decided.
It'll be very good for you...
...and most amusing for me.
I shall inform the others.
Inform the who? What?
No. No. No... Wait.
We do not want any adventures here,
thank you. Not today. Not...
I suggest you try Over the Hill
or Across the Water.
Good morning.
Dwalin, at your service.
Hm. Uh...
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.
Do we know each other?
No.
Which way, laddie?
Is it down here?
Is what down where?
Supper.
He said there'd be food and lots of it.
He... He said? Who said?
Mmm.
Mmm.
Very good, this. Any more?
What? Oh, yes, yes. Ah.
Help yourself.
Hmm. It's just that, um,
I wasn't expecting company.
That'll be the door.
Balin, at your service.
- Good evening.
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?
Am I late?
Late for what?
Oh! Ha, ha!
Evening, brother.
By my beard...
...you're shorter and
wider than last we met.
Wider, not shorter.
Sharp enough for both of us.
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure
you're in the right house.
Have you eaten?
It's not that I don't like visitors.
I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit.
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.
- What is this?
- I don't know.
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.
- It's riddled with mold.
The thing is, I don't know either of you.
Not in the slightest.
I don't mean to be blunt,
but I had to speak my mind.
- I'm sorry.
- You think...?
Apology accepted.
- Ah.
- Now, fill it up, brother, don't stint.
- You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.
- Fili.
- And Kili.
At your service.
- You must be Mr. Boggins.
- Nope! You can't come in.
- You've come to the wrong house.
- What?
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.
- No, nothing's been canceled.
- That's a relief.
Careful with these.
I just had them sharpened.
- It's nice, this place.
- Yeah.
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.
Shove this in the hallway.
Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.
"Everyone"? How many more are there?
- Where do you want this?
- Oh, no.
- It's really heavy.
- No. No. There's nobody home!
Go away and bother somebody else.
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.
If this is some clot-head's
idea of a joke...
...I can only say it is in very poor taste.
Get off, you big lump!
Gandalf.
Those are my pri...! Excuse me, not my wine.
Put that back. Put that back.
Not the jam, please.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
It's a tad excessive, isn't it?
Have you got a cheese knife?
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.
- Ugh.
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair...
No, so is that. Take it back, please.
- I cannot hear what you're saying. BILBO:
- It's an antique. Not for sitting on.
That is a book, not a coaster.
And put that map down.
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?
Oh, no, thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.
- Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...
Oin, Gloin.
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...
- ...Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.
No, thank you.
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.
We appear to be one Dwarf short.
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine,
as requested.
It's got a fruity bouquet.
Oh. Cheers.
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.
Hmm.
No chance. Not from that distance.
Wanna bet?
Bombur, catch!
I'll help you with that.
Oh, you great galumphing git!
- Who wants an ale? There you go.
- Over here, brother.
I said have another drink. Here you go.
Ale on the count of three!
One, two...
Up!
I knew you had it in you!
Excuse me, that is a
doily, not a dishcloth.
But it's full of holes.
It's supposed to look like that.
It's crochet.
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.
Be bother and confusticate these Dwarves!
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by Dwarves.
What are they doing here?
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering
once you get used to them.
I don't want to get used to them.
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.
They've pillaged the pantry.
I won't tell you what they've done
in the bathroom.
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.
Take that back. Excuse me.
That's my mother's West Farthing pottery.
It's over 100 years old!
And can you not do that? You'll blunt them.
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?
He says we'll blunt the knives.
Blunt the knives, bend the forks 
Smash the bottles and bum the corks 
Chip the glasses and crack the plates 
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates 
Cut the cloth, tread on the fat 
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat 
Pour the milk on the pantry floor 
Splash the wine on every door 
Dump the crooks in a boiling bowl 
Pound them up with a thumping pole 
When you're finished, if they are whole 
Send them down the hall to roll 
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates 
Bilbo.
He is here.
Gandalf.
I thought you said this place
would be easy to find.
I lost my way, twice.
I wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.
There is a mark. I put it there myself.
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company:
Thorin Oakenshield.
So...
...this is the Hobbit.
Tell me, Mr. Baggins,
have you done much fighting?
- Pardon me?
- Ax or sword?
What's your weapon of choice?
Well, I do have some skill at conkers,
if you must know...
...but I fail to see why that's relevant.
Thought as much.
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.
What news from the meeting in Ered Luin?
Did they all come?
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.
- All of them!
And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?
Is Dain with us?
They will not come.
They say this quest is ours and ours alone.
You're going on a quest?
Bilbo, my dear fellow,
let us have a little more light.
Far to the east...
...over ranges and rivers...
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...
...lies a single, solitary peak.
"The Lonely Mountain."
Aye, Oin has read the portents...
...and the portents say it is time.
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain, as it was foretold.
"When the birds of yore return to Erebor...
...the reign of the beast will end."
Uh, what beast?
That would be a reference
to Smaug the Terrible...
...chiefest and greatest
calamity of our age.
Airborne fire-breather.
Teeth like razors, claws like meat hooks.
- Extremely fond of precious metals.
- Yes, I know what a dragon is.
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron
right up his jacksie!
- Good lad, Ori!
- Sit down.
The task would be difficult enough
with an army behind us...
...but we number just 13.
And not 13 of the best...
...nor brightest.
Here, who are you calling dim?
Sorry, what did he say?
We may be few in number...
...but we're fighters, all of us,
to the last Dwarf.
And you forget,
we have a Wizard in our company.
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons in his time.
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...
- How many, then?
- What?
Well, how many dragons have you killed?
Go on. Give us a number.
Excuse me. Please.
If we have read these signs...
...do you not think others
will have read them too?
Rumors have begun to spread.
The dragon, Smaug,
has not been seen for 60 years.
Eyes look east to the
mountain, assessing...
...wondering, weighing the risk.
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.
Do we sit back while others claim
what is rightfully ours?
Or do we seize this chance
to take back Erebor?
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.
There is no way into the mountain.
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.
How come you by this?
It was given to me by your father.
By Thrain. For safekeeping.
It is yours now.
If there is a key...
...there must be a door.
These runes speak of a hidden
passage to the Lower Halls.
There's another way in.
Well, if we can find it,
but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
The answer lies hidden somewhere
in this map...
...and I do not have the skill to find it.
But there are others in Middle-earth
who can.
The task I have in mind
will require a great deal of stealth...
...and no small amount of courage.
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.
That's why we need a burglar.
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.
And are you?
Am I what?
He said he's an expert. Hey.
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree
with Mr. Baggins.
He's hardly burglar material.
Nope.
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk who
can neither fight nor fend for themselves.
He's just fine.
Enough!
If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar,
then a burglar he is.
Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.
In fact, they can pass unseen by most,
if they choose.
And, while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of Dwarf...
...the scent of a Hobbit
is all but unknown to him...
...which gives us a distinct advantage.
You asked me to find the 14th member of
this company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.
There's a lot more to him
than appearances suggest.
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.
Including himself.
You must trust me on this.
Very well.
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.
- Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.
It's just the usual.
Summary of out-of-pocket expenses...
...time required, remuneration...
...funeral arrangements, so forth.
Funeral arrangements?
I cannot guarantee his safety.
Understood.
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.
Agreed.
"Terms: Cash on delivery, up to but not exceeding
one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."
Hmm. Seems fair.
"Present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by...
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...
...evisceration..."
Incineration?
Aye. He'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.
- You all right, laddie?
- Huh? Yeah.
Feel a bit faint.
- Think furnace with wings.
- Air.
I need air.
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof.
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.
Hmm.
Nope.
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.
I'll be all right.
Just let me sit quietly for a moment.
You've been sitting
quietly for far too long.
Tell me, when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...
...become so important to you?
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.
A young Hobbit who would have liked
nothing better...
...than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.
The world is not in your books and maps.
It's out there.
I can't just go running off into the blue.
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.
You are also a Took.
Did you know that your
great-great-great-great-uncle Bullroarer Took...
...was so large, he could
ride a real horse?
- Yes.
- Yes, well, he could.
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.
He swung his club so hard, it knocked
the Goblin king's head clean off...
...and it sailed 100 yards through the air
and went down a rabbit hole.
And thus, the battle was won.
And the game of golf invented
at the same time.
I do believe you made that up.
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.
You'll have a tale or two to tell
of your own when you come back.
Can you promise that I will come back?
No.
And if you do...
...you will not be the same.
That's what I thought.
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.
You've got the wrong Hobbit.
It appears we have lost our burglar.
Probably for the best.
The odds were always against us.
After all, what are we?
Merchants, miners...
...tinkers, toy-makers.
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.
There are a few warriors amongst us.
Old warriors.
I would take each and every one
of these Dwarves...
...over an army from the Iron Hills.
For when I called upon them,
they answered.
Loyalty, honor...
...a willing heart.
I can ask no more than that.
You don't have to do this.
You have a choice.
You've done honorably by our people.
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.
A life of peace and plenty.
A life that is worth more than
all the gold in Erebor.
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.
They dreamt of the day when the Dwarves
of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.
There is no choice, Balin.
Not for me.
Then we are with you, laddie.
We will see it done.
Far over the misty mountains cold 
To dungeons deep 
And caverns old 
We must away 
'Ere break of day 
To find our long-forgotten gold 
The pines were roaring on the height 
The winds were moaning in the night 
The fire was red, it flaming spread 
The trees like torches 
Blazed with light 
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
Here, Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?
I'm going on an adventure!
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Coming here was a waste of time.
That's true enough.
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit?
A Halfling?
Whose idea was it anyway?
Wait!
Wait!
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
I signed it.
Here.
Everything appears to be in order.
Welcome, Master Baggins...
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.
Give him a pony.
No, no, that won't be necessary.
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.
I've done my fair share of
walking holidays, you know?
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!
Come on, Nori. Pay up.
- One more.
- Thanks, lad.
What's that about?
Oh, they took wagers
on whether or not you'd turn up.
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.
And what did you think?
Well...
My dear fellow,
I never doubted you for a second.
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.
No, wait, wait, stop.
Stop! We have to turn around.
What on earth is the matter?
- I forgot my handkerchief.
- Here.
Use this.
Move on.
You'll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs...
...and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins...
...before we reach our journey's end.
You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.
But home is now behind you.
The world is ahead.
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?
It's our little secret, Myrtle.
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.
What was that?
Orcs.
Orcs?
Throat-cutters.
There'll be dozens of them out there.
The lone-lands are crawling with them.
They strike in the wee small hours
when everyone's asleep.
Quick and quiet, no screams.
Just lots of blood.
You think that's funny?
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?
We didn't mean anything by it.
No, you didn't.
You know nothing of the world.
Don't mind him, laddie.
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.
After the dragon took
the Lonely Mountain...
...King Thror tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.
But our enemy had got there first.
Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs...
...led by the most vile of all their race:
Azog the Defiler.
The giant Gundabad Orc...
...had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.
He began...
...by beheading the king.
No!
Thrain, Thorin's father,
was driven mad by grief.
He went missing. Taken
prisoner or killed...
...we did not know.
We were leaderless.
Defeat and death...
...were upon us.
That is when I saw him.
A young Dwarf prince...
...facing down the pale Orc.
He stood alone against this terrible foe.
His armor rent...
...wielding nothing but an oaken branch
as a shield.
Azog the Defiler learned that day...
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.
Our forces rallied...
wand drove the Orcs back.
And our enemy...
...had been defeated.
But there was no feast...
...nor song that night...
...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.
We few had survived.
And I thought to myself then...
...there is one who I could follow.
There is one...
...I could call king.
And the pale Orc?
What happened to him?
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.
That filth died of his wounds long ago.
Here, Mr. Gandalf, can't you do something
about this deluge?
It is raining, Master Dwarf...
...and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done.
If you wish to change the weather of the world,
you should find yourself another Wizard.
- Are there any?
- What?
- Other Wizards.
- There are five of us.
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the White.
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...
Do you know,
I've quite forgotten their names.
And who is the fifth?
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.
Is he a great Wizard?
Or is he more like you?
I think he's a very great Wizard,
in his own way.
He's a gentle soul who prefers
the company of animals to others.
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest lands...
...to the east. And a good thing too.
For always evil will look to find
a foothold in this world.
Not good. Not good at all.
Eww.
Oh, no. Sebastian.
Good gracious.
Come on.
Move back! Give him some air,
for goodness sake.
There. There.
I don't understand why it's not working.
It's not as if it's witchcraft.
Witchcraft.
Oh, but it is.
A dark and powerful magic.
Where on this good earth
did those foul creatures come from?
The old fortress?
Show me.
We'll camp here for the night.
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.
A farmer and his family used to live here.
- Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.
- Aye.
Right you are.
I think it would be wiser to move on.
We could make for the Hidden Valley.
I have told you already...
...I will not go near that place.
Why not? The Elves could help us.
We could get food, rest, advice.
I do not need their advice.
We have a map that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.
Help?
A dragon attacks Erebor.
What help came from the Elves?
Orcs plunder Moria...
...desecrate our sacred halls.
The Elves looked on and did nothing.
And you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grandfather.
Who betrayed my father.
You are neither of them.
I did not give you that map and key
for you to hold onto the past.
I did not know that they
were yours to keep.
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?
To seek the company of the
only one around here who's got any sense.
- And who's that?
- Myself, Mr. Baggins.
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.
Is he coming back?
He's been a long time.
- Who?
- Gandalf.
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.
Stop it. You've had plenty.
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur.
I've had worse.
Dori could've cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.
Hilarious.
What's the matter?
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.
We had 16.
Now there's 14.
Daisy and Bungo are missing.
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.
As our official burglar,
we thought you might like to look into it.
Well, uh...
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.
It's something very big
and possibly quite dangerous.
Hey.
There's a light.
Over here.
Stay down.
What is it?
Trolls.
Oh.
He's got Myrtle and Minty.
I think they're gonna eat them.
We have to do something.
Yes, you should.
Mountain Trolls are slow and stupid,
and you're so small, they'll never see you.
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.
If you run into trouble, hoot twice
like a barn owl and once like a brown owl.
Twice like a barn owl.
No, twice like a brown... Once like a...
Like a... Are you sure this is a good idea?
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...
...and, blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.
Quit your griping.
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have.
Not enough fat on them.
Well, it's better than leathery old farmer.
All skin and bone, he was. I'm still
picking bits of him out of me teeth.
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.
Might improve the flavor.
Ah. There's more where that came from.
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Ow!
Sit down!
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.
I don't like the stinky parts.
- Ow!
- I said sit down.
I'm starving!
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?
Shut your cakehole.
You'll eat what I give you.
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.
Everything tastes like chicken.
Except the chicken.
What tastes like fish!
I'm just saying,
a little appreciation would be nice.
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert.
Lovely stew, Bert."
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.
Here, that's my grog.
Sorry. Ow!
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?
Good, isn't it?
That's why I'm the cook.
Oh, my guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.
- Flesh, I need flesh.
- Ah! Ah!
Blimey!
Bert. Bert!
Look what's come out of me hooter.
It's got arms and legs and everything.
What is it?
I don't know. But I don't like
the way it wriggles around.
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.
A burglar Hobbit?
Can we cook him?
We can try.
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.
Not when he's skinned and boned.
Perhaps there's more burglar Hobbits
around these parts.
Might be enough for a pie.
- Grab him!
- He's too quick.
Right. Come here, you little...
Gotcha.
Are there any more of you little fellas
hiding where you shouldn't?
No.
He's lying.
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.
Make him squeal!
Drop him!
You what?
I said...
...drop him.
Get the sacks! Stick them in the sacks!
Ow!
Come on! Get up!
- Bilbo!
- Don't!
Lay down your arms...
...or we'll rip his off.
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!
Don't bother cooking them.
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.
They should be sauted and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.
Is this really necessary?
That does sound quite nice.
- Untie me, mister.
- Eat someone your own size.
Never mind the seasoning.
We ain't got all night.
Dawn ain't far away.
Let's get a move on.
I don't fancy being turned to stone.
Wait!
You are making a terrible mistake.
You can't reason with them.
They're half-wits!
Half-wits? What does that make us?
I meant with the seasoning.
What about the seasoning?
Well, have you smelt them?
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.
- Traitor!
- What do you know about cooking Dwarf?
Shut up.
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
- It's, uh...
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...
...to skin them first.
What? Skin us?
Tom, get me filleting knife.
I'll skin you, you little...!
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.
What a load of rubbish.
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.
Scarf them, I say, boots and all.
He's right.
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.
Nice and crunchy.
Oh, not that one. He's infected.
- Huh?
- You what?
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.
- Eww!
- Aah!
In fact, they all have.
They're infested with parasites.
It's a terrible business.
I wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't.
Parasites? Did he say "parasites"?
We don't have parasites.
You have parasites!
What are you talking about, laddie?
I've got parasites as big as my arm.
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.
- We're riddled.
- Yes, I'm riddled.
Yes, we are, badly.
What would you have us do, then?
Let them all go?
- Well...
- You think I don't know what you're up to?
This little ferret is taking us for fools.
- Ferret?
- Fools?
The dawn will take you all.
- Who's that?
- No idea.
Can we eat him too?
Get your foot out of my back.
Ah.
Where did you go to, if I may ask?
To look ahead.
- What brought you back?
- Looking behind.
Nasty business.
Still, they're all in one piece.
No thanks to your burglar.
He had the nous to play for time.
None of the rest of you thought of that.
They must have come down
from the Ettenmoors.
Since when do Mountain Trolls
venture this far south?
Ooh. Not for an age.
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.
They could not have moved in daylight.
There must be a cave nearby.
Oh, what's that stench?
It's a Troll-hoard.
Be careful what you touch.
Seems a shame
just to leave it lying around.
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.
- Nori.
- Yeah?
Get a shovel.
These swords were not made by any Troll.
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.
These were forged in Gondolin...
...by the High Elves of the First Age.
You could not wish for a finer blade.
- Set it down.
- That's good.
All right, come on. Quick.
We're making a long-term deposit.
Let's get out of this foul place.
Come on, let's go.
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.
- Bilbo.
- Hmm?
Here.
This is about your size.
I can't take this.
The blade is of Elvish make...
...which means it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.
I have never used a sword in my life.
And I hope you never have to.
But if you do, remember this:
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...
...but when to spare one.
Something's coming!
- Gandalf.
- Stay together!
Hurry now! Arm yourselves!
Thieves! Fire! Murder!
Radagast.
It's Radagast the Brown.
Well...
What on earth are you doing here?
I was looking for you, Gandalf.
Somethings wrong.
Somethings terribly wrong.
Yes?
Oh.
Just give me a minute.
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.
It was right there on the tip of my tongue.
Oh. It's not a thought at all.
It's a silly old...
...stick insect.
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.
A darkness has fallen over it.
Nothing grows anymore.
At least, nothing good.
The air is foul with decay.
But worse are the webs.
Webs? What do you mean?
Spiders, Gandalf.
Giant ones.
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I am not a Wizard.
I followed their trail.
They came from Dol Guldur.
Huh?
Dol Guldur?
But the old fortress is abandoned.
No, Gandalf.
'Tis not.
A dark power dwells in there...
...such as I have never felt before.
It is the shadow of an ancient horror.
One that can summon the spirits...
...of the dead.
I saw him, Gandalf.
From out of the darkness...
...a Necromancer has come.
Radagast.
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!
Wait for me!
Sorry.
Try a little Old Toby.
It'll help settle your nerves.
And out.
Now, a Necromancer. Are you sure?
That is not...
...from the world of the living.
Was that a wolf?
Are there wolves out there?
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.
Kili! Get your bow!
Warg scouts.
- Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.
- Orc pack?
Who did you tell about your quest
beyond your kin?
- No one.
- Who did you tell?
No one, I swear.
What in Durin's name is going on?
You are being hunted.
- We have to get out of here.
- We can't. We have no ponies.
They bolted.
I'll draw them off.
These are Gundabad Wargs.
They will outrun you.
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.
I'd like to see them try.
Come on! Come on!
Come and get me! Ha, ha!
Come on.
Stay together.
Move!
Ori, no! Get back.
All of you, come on. Quick!
Where are you leading us?
Move!
Run!
There they are!
This way! Quickly!
There's more coming!
Kili! Shoot them!
We're surrounded!
Where's Gandalf?
He's abandoned us.
Hold your ground!
This way, you fools!
Come on, move!
Quickly! All of you!
Come on!
Go, go, go!
Eight, nine, 10.
Kili! Run!
Elves.
I cannot see where the pathway leads.
Do we follow it or not?
Follow it, of course.
I think that would be wise.
Come on now, brother.
The Valley of Imladris.
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.
Rivendell.
Here lies the Last Homely House
East of the Sea.
This was your plan all along.
To seek refuge with our enemy.
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.
The only ill will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself.
You think the Elves will give our quest
their blessing?
They will try to stop us.
Of course they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.
And respect.
And no small degree of charm.
Which is why you will leave the talking
to me.
Mithrandir.
Ah. Lindir.
Stay sharp.
I must speak with Lord Elrond.
My Lord Elrond is not here.
Not here?
Where is he?
Close ranks!
- Gandalf.
- Lord Elrond.
Strange for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.
Something or someone
has drawn them near.
That may have been us.
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.
I do not believe we have met.
You have your grandfather's bearing.
I knew Thror
when he ruled Under the Mountain.
Indeed? He made no mention of you.
What is he saying?
Does he offer us insult?
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.
Well, in that case, lead on.
Hey. Come on.
Try it. Just a mouthful.
I don't like green food.
Where's the meat?
Have they got any chips?
Kind of you to invite us.
Not really dressed for dinner.
Well, you never are.
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.
A famous blade...
...forged by the High Elves of the West,
my kin.
May it serve you well.
And this is Glamdring...
...the Foehammer.
Sword of the King of Gondolin.
These were made for the Goblin Wars
of the First Age.
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords are
named for the great deeds they do in war.
What are you saying,
my sword hasn't seen battle?
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.
More of a letter opener, really.
How did you come by these?
We found them in a Troll-hoard
on the Great East Road...
...shortly before we were
ambushed by Orcs.
And what were you doing
on the Great East Road?
Our business is no concern of Elves.
For goodness sake, Thorin,
show him the map.
It is the legacy of my people.
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.
Your pride will be your downfall.
You stand in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.
Thorin, no.
Erebor.
What is your interest in this map?
It's mainly academic.
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?
Moon runes?
Of course.
An easy thing to miss.
Well, in this case, that is true.
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...
...of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written.
Can you read them?
These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.
The same moon shines upon us tonight.
"Stand by the gray stone
when the thrush knocks...
...and the setting sun with the last light
of Durin's Day...
...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.
This is ill news.
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.
We still have time.
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.
So this is your purpose,
to enter the mountain?
What of it?
There are some
who would not deem it wise.
What do you mean?
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.
No, you did the same thing.
- It's not like you didn't do it.
- Dori! Here, take that.
Bombur!
With or without our help, these Dwarves
will march on the mountain.
They're determined to reclaim
their homeland.
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he is answerable to anyone.
Nor, for that matter, am I.
It is not me you must answer to.
Lady Galadriel.
Mithrandir.
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.
He didn't.
I did.
Ah.
Saruman.
You've been busy of late, my friend.
Tell me, Gandalf...
...did you think these plans and schemes
of yours would go unnoticed?
Unnoticed?
No.
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.
The dragon has long been on your mind.
That is true, my lady.
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.
But if he should side with the enemy...
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.
What enemy?
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.
Gandalf, for 400 years
we have lived in peace...
...a hard-won, watchful peace.
Are we? Are we at peace?
Trolls have come down
from the mountains.
They are raiding villages,
destroying farms.
Orcs have attacked us on the road.
Hardly a prelude to war.
Always you must meddle...
...looking for trouble where none exists.
Let him speak.
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.
Something far more powerful.
We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood.
And they say...
Well? Don't stop now.
Tell us what the woodsmen say.
They speak of a Necromancer
living in Dol Guldur.
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.
That's absurd.
No such power exists in this world.
This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.
And so I thought too.
- But Radagast has seen...
- Radagast?
Do not speak to me
of Radagast the Brown.
He's a foolish fellow.
Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.
It's not that. It's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.
They've addled his brain
and yellowed his teeth.
I've warned him.
It is unbefitting one of the Istari
to be wandering the woods...
You carry something.
It came to you from Radagast.
He found it in Dol Guldur.
Yes.
Show me.
...Listen to me.
I would think I was talking to myself
for all the attention that he paid.
By all means...
What is that?
A relic of Mordor.
A Morgul Blade.
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.
And buried with him.
When Angmar fell...
...the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...
...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.
Deep within the rock they buried him...
...in a tomb so dark...
...it would never come to light.
This is not possible.
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.
They cannot be opened.
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave?
- I have none.
- Because there is none.
Let us examine what we know.
A single Orc pack...
...has dared to cross the Bruinen.
A dagger from a bygone age
has been found.
And a human sorcerer who calls himself
"The Necromancer"...
...has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.
It's not so very much after all.
The question of this Dwarvish company,
however, troubles me deeply.
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.
If they'd come to me, I might have
spared them this disappointment.
I do not pretend to understand your reason
for raising their hopes.
They are leaving.
Yes.
You knew.
No, I'm afraid there is
nothing else for it.
My Lord Elrond.
The Dwarves, they're gone.
Be on your guard.
We're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.
Aye.
Master Baggins...
...I suggest you keep up.
- You will follow them.
- Yes.
You are right to help
Thorin Oakenshield.
But I fear this quest has set in motion...
...forces we do not yet understand.
The riddle of the Morgul Blade
must be answered.
Something moves in the shadows unseen,
hidden from our sight.
It will not show itself.
Not yet.
But every day it grows in strength.
You must be careful.
Mithrandir?
Why the Halfling?
I do not know.
Saruman believes
that it is only great power...
...that can hold evil in check.
But that is not what I have found.
I have found it is the small things...
...everyday deeds of ordinary folk...
...that keeps the darkness at bay.
Simple acts of kindness and love.
Why Bilbo Baggins?
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...
...and he gives me courage.
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.
You are not alone.
Hey! Hold on!
- Aah!
- Bilbo!
We must find shelter!
Look out!
Look out, brother!
Hold on!
This is no thunderstorm.
It's a thunder-battle!
Look!
Well, bless me.
The legends are true.
Giants! Stone-Giants!
Take cover, you fool!
Hold on!
- What's happening?
- Grab my hand!
- Go, go, go!
- Run! Get off! Get off!
- Run!
- Look out!
Look out!
Jump!
Come on!
Hold on!
No!
No!
No! Kili!
It's all right! They're alive!
Where's Bilbo? Where's the Hobbit?
There!
Get him!
Aah!
- Grab my hand!
- Bilbo!
- Ori, be careful!
- Take it!
- I've got you, lad.
- Grab on! Grab on!
Come on. Get him.
Come on, lad. Up you get.
I thought we'd lost our burglar.
He's been lost ever since he left home.
He should never have come.
He has no place amongst us.
Dwalin!
- It looks safe enough.
- Search to the back.
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.
There's nothing here.
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.
No. No fires. Not in this place.
Get some sleep.
We start at first light.
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.
- That was the plan.
- Plans change.
Bofur, take the first watch.
Where do you think you're going?
Back to Rivendell.
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?
You're part of the company.
You're one of us.
I'm not, though, am I?
Thorin said I should never have come
and he was right.
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.
- I should never have run out my door.
- You're homesick. I understand.
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.
You're Dwarves.
You're used to this life.
To living on the road, never settling
in one place, not belonging anywhere!
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...
No, you're right.
We don't belong anywhere.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
I really do.
What's that?
Hmm?
Wake up! Wake up!
Whoa!
Look out! Look out!
Get away!
Filthy scum!
Get back!
You'll pay for this!
Got you.
All right, all right. Don't push.
Get off! Get your hands off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Who would be so bold
as to come armed into my kingdom?
Spies? Thieves? Assassins?
Dwarves, You r Malevolence.
Dwarves?
We found them on the Front Porch.
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.
Every crack. Every crevice.
What are you doing in these parts?
Speak!
Very well. If they will not talk,
we'll make them squawk.
Bring up the mangler.
Bring up the bonebreaker.
- Start with the youngest.
- Wait!
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...
...King Under the Mountain.
Oh, but I'm forgetting.
You don't have a mountain.
And you're not a king...
...which makes you nobody, really.
I know someone who would
pay a pretty price for your head.
Just a head.
Nothing attached.
Perhaps you Know of whom I speak.
An old enemy of yours.
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.
He was slain in battle long ago.
So you think his defiling days are done,
do you?
Send word to the pale Orc.
Tell him I have found his prize.
Yes!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Gollum, gollum!
Aah!
Nasty Goblinses!
Better than old bones, precious.
Better than nothing.
Too many boneses, precious.
Not enough flesh!
Shut up! Cut its skin off.
Start with its head.
The cold hard lands 
They bites our hands 
They gnaws our feet 
The rocks and stones 
They're like old bones 
All bare of meat 
Cold as death Without no breath 
It's good to eat 
Bless us and splash us, precious.
That's a meaty mouthful.
Gollum, gollum! Aah.
Back. Stay back.
I'm warning you, don't come any closer.
It's got an Elfish blade.
But it's not an Elfs.
Not an Elfs, no.
What is it, precious?
What is it?
My name is Bilbo Baggins.
Bagginses?
What is a Bagginses, precious?
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
- Oh.
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes.
But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.
Is it soft? Is it juicy?
Now, now, keep your distance!
I'll use this if I have to.
Aah!
I don't want any trouble,
do you understand?
Just show me the way to get out of here
and I'll be on my way.
Why? Is it lost?
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost
as soon as possible.
Ooh, we knows!
We knows safe paths for Hobbitses.
Safe paths in the dark.
Shut up!
- I didn't say anything.
- We wasn't talking to you.
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.
Look, I don't know what your game is,
but I...
Games?!
Oh, we love games,
doesn't we, precious?
Does it like games? Does it, does it?
Does it like to play?
Maybe.
What has roots as nobody sees?
Is taller than trees?
Up, up, up it goes
And yet, never grows
- The mountain.
- Yes, yes.
Oh, let's have another one, eh?
Yes! Do it again, do it again. Ask us.
No! No more riddles.
Finish him off. Finish him now!
Gollum, gollum!
No! No. No.
No. I want to play. I do.
I want to play. I can see...
...you are very good at this.
So why don't we...
...have a game of riddles? Yes?
Just you and me.
Yes. Yes, just us.
Yes. Yes.
And if I win...
...you show me the way out. Yes?
Yes. Yes.
And if it loses? What then?
Well, if it loses, precious,
then we eats it!
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.
Fair enough.
Well, Baggins first.
Thirty white horses on a red hill
First they champ, then they stamp
Then they stand still
Teeth?
Teeth! Oh, yes, my precious!
But we... We only have nine.
Our turn.
Voiceless, it cries
Wingless flutters
Toothless bites
Mouthless mutters
Just a minute. Uh...
Oh. Oh!
We knows! We knows!
Shut up!
Wind.
It's wind. Of course it is.
Very clever, Hobbitses.
Very clever.
Ah-ah-ah.
A box without hinges, key or lid
Yet golden treasure inside is hid
Box.
Oh, um...
Box. The lid and a key.
- Well?
- It's nasty.
- Box. Key.
- Do you give up?
Give us a chance, precious!
Give us a chance!
Eggses!
Eggses!
Wet, crunchy little eggses. Yes.
Grandmother taught us
to suck them, yes!
We have one for you.
All things it devours
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers
Gnaws iron, bites steel
Grinds hard stones to meal
Answer us.
Give me a moment, please.
I gave you a good long while.
Birds, beasts... Beasts?
Trees, flowers.
I don't know this one.
Is it tasty?
Is it scrumptious?
Is it crunchable?
Let me think.
Let me think.
It's stuck.
Bagginses is stuck.
Time's up.
Time.
The answer is time.
Actually it wasn't that hard.
Last question.
Last chance.
Okay.
Ask us.
- Ask us!
- Yes, yes. All right.
What have I got in my pocket?
That's no fair.
It's not fair! It's against the rules!
Now ask us another one.
No. No, no, no.
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.
What have I got in my pocket?
Three guesses, precious.
It must give us three!
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.
Handses!
Wrong. Guess again.
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...
Knife! Oh, shut up!
Wrong again. Last guess.
String. Or nothing.
Two guesses at once.
Wrong both times.
So...
Come, then. I won the game.
You promised to show me the way out.
Did we say so, precious?
Did we say so?
What has it got in its pocketses?
That's no concern of yours.
You lost.
Lost?
Lost?
Lost?
Where is it?
Where is it?!
No!
Where is it?!
No! No!
Lost!
Curse us and splash us!
My precious is lost!
- What have you lost?
- Mustn't ask us! Not its business!
No!
Gollum, gollum!
What has it got...
...in its nasty...
little pocketses?
He stole it.
He stole it!
He stole it!
Bones will be shattered 
Necks will be wrung 
You'll be beaten and battered 
From racks you'll be hung 
You will die down here 
And never he found 
Down in the deep of Goblin-town 
I know that sword!
It is the Goblin-cleaver!
The Biter!
The blade that sliced 1000 necks!
Slash them! Beat them! Kill them!
Kill them all!
Cut off his head!
Take up arms.
Fight.
Fight!
He wields the Foehammer! The Beater!
Bright as daylight!
Thorin!
Follow me. Quick!
Run!
Give it to us!
It's ours.
It's ours!
Thief!
Baggins!
Quickly!
Faster!
Post!
Charge!
Cut the ropes!
Come on, quickly!
- Come on, move!
- Bombur!
Go, go, go!
Jump!
Jump, lad!
Come on!
Push!
Come on!
Come on!
- Watch your backs!
- You thought you could escape me.
What are you going to do now, Wizard?
That'll do it.
Well, that could have been worse.
Haver!
You've got to be joking!
Gandalf!
There's too many. We can't fight them.
Only one thing will save us, daylight!
Come on! Here! On your feet.
- Balin.
- Come on!
Wait!
My precious. Wait!
Gollum, gollum!
Quick, quick!
This way.
- Come on.
- Come on, come on. Quickly.
Right, good!
Baggins!
Thief!
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!
Five, six, seven, eight.
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.
Fili, Kili! That's 12.
And Bombur. That makes 13.
Where's Bilbo?
Where is our Hobbit?
Where is our Hobbit?
Curse that Halfling! Now he's lost?
I thought he was with Dori!
- Don't blame me!
- Well, where did you last see him?
I think I saw him slip away
when they first collared us.
And what happened, exactly?
- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.
Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...
...since first he stepped out of his door.
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.
He is long gone.
No. He isn't.
Bilbo Baggins.
I have never been so glad
to see anyone in my life.
Bilbo. We'd given you up.
How on earth
did you get past the Goblins?
How, indeed.
Well, what does it matter? He's back.
It matters. I want to know.
Why did you come back?
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.
And you're right, I often think of Bag-end.
I miss my books.
And my armchair and my garden.
See, that's where I belong.
That's home.
And that's why I came back. Because...
...you don't have one. A home.
It was taken from you.
But I will help you take it back if I can.
Out of the frying pan.
And into the fire. Run.
Run!
Go!
Up into the trees!
All of you! Come on, climb! Bilbo, climb!
Quickly!
They're coming!
- Hang on!
- Hold on, brothers!
Azog.
It cannot be.
It's going!
Fili!
Yeah!
No!
Oh, no.
Mr. Gandalf!
Oh, no, Dori!
Help!
No!
Thorin! No!
Look.
Thorin!
Thorin!
Thorin.
The Halfling?
It's all right.
Bilbo is here. He's quite safe.
You!
What were you doing?
You nearly got yourself killed!
Did I not say that
you would be a burden?
That you would not survive in the Wild?
That you had no place amongst us?
I have never been so wrong in all my life.
But I'm sorry I doubted you.
No, I would have doubted me too.
I'm not a hero or a warrior.
Not even a burglar.
Is that what I think it is?
Erebor...
...the Lonely Mountain...
...the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms
of Middle-earth.
Our home.
A raven!
The birds are returning to the mountain.
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.
But we'll take it as a sign.
- A good omen.
- You're right.
I do believe the worst is behind us.
Far over the misty mountains rise 
Leave us standing upon the height 
What was before 
We see once more 
Is our kingdom a distant light 
Fiery mountain beneath the moon 
The words unspoken, we'll be there soon 
For home a song 
That echoes on 
And all who find us will know the tune 
Some folk we never forget 
Some kind we never forgive 
Haven't seen the back of us yet 
We'll fight as long as we live 
All eyes on the hidden door 
To the Lonely Mountain borne 
We'll ride in the gathering storm 
Until we get our long-forgotten gold 
We lay under the misty mountains cold 
In slumbers deep 
And dreams of gold 
We must awake 
Our lives to make 
And in the darkness a torch we hold 
From long ago when lanterns burned 
Until this day 
Our hearts have yearned 
Her fate unknown 
The Arkenstone 
What was stolen 
Must be returned 
We must awake 
And make the day 
To find a song for heart and soul 
Some folk we never forget 
Some kind we never forgive 
Haven't seen the end of it yet 
We'll fight as long as we live 
All eyes on the hidden door 
To the Lonely Mountain borne 
We'll ride in the gathering storm 
Till we get our long-forgotten gold 
Far away from misty mountains cold 

I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!
- Here you are.
- Thank you kindly.
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Master Stadle.
Mind if I join you?
I'll have the same.
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.
Gandalf the Grey.
I know who you are.
Well, now. This is a fine chance.
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?
I received word that my father...
...had been seen wandering...
...the Wilds near Dunland.
I went looking.
I found no sign of him.
Thorin, it's been a long time...
...since anything but rumor was heard...
...of Thrain.
He still lives.
I am sure of it.
My father came to see you
before he went missing.
What did you say to him?
I urged him to march upon Erebor,
to rally...
...the seven armies of the Dwarves...
...to destroy the dragon and take back...
...the Lonely Mountain.
And I would say the same to you.
Take back your homeland.
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?
No.
It is not.
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...
...Thorin. That dragon
has sat there long enough.
Sooner or later...
...darker minds will turn towards Erebor.
I ran into some unsavory characters...
...whilst traveling on the Greenway.
They mistook me for a vagabond.
I imagine they regretted that.
One of them was carrying a message.
It is Black Speech.
A promise of payment.
For what?
Your head.
Someone wants you dead.
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...
...the heir to the Throne of Durin.
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.
Together, you have the might and power...
...to retake Erebor.
Summon a meeting
of the seven Dwarf families.
Demand they stand by their oath.
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.
The Arkenstone.
It is the only thing that will...
...unite them,
and in case you have forgotten...
...that jewel was stolen by Smaug.
What if I were to help you reclaim it?
How?
The Arkenstone lies half a world away...
...buried beneath the feet
of a fire-breathing dragon.
Yes, it does.
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.
How close is the pack?
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
- Not yet. But they will do.
- We have another problem.
- Did they see you?
They saw you.
No, that's not it.
What did I tell you?
Quiet as a mouse.
Excellent burglar material.
Will you listen? Will you just...
...listen?
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.
What form did it take?
Like a bear?
Ye... Yes, but bigger.
Much bigger.
You knew about this beast?
I say we double back.
And be run down by a pack of Orcs?
There is a house...
...it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.
Whose house?
Are they friend or foe?
Neither.
He will help us or...
...he will kill us.
What choice do we have?
None.
Come on!
This way! Quickly!
Run!
Bombur, come on!
To the house!
Run!
Come on, get inside.
Open the door!
Quickly!
- Push!
- Push!
Dwalin!
Come on, lads!
What is...
...that?
That is our host.
His name is Beorn.
And he's a skin-changer.
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.
Sometimes he's a great strong man.
The bear is unpredictable...
...but the man can be reasoned with.
However...
...he is not overfond of Dwarves.
He's leaving.
Come away from there.
It's not natural. None of it.
It's obvious. He's under some...
...dark spell.
Don't be a fool.
He's under no enchantment but his own.
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.
You'll be safe here tonight.
I hope.
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.
Tell me...
...why is Azog...
...the Defiler hunting you?
You know of Azog?
How?
My people were the first to live
in the mountains...
...before the Orcs came down
from the North.
The Defiler killed most of my family.
But some he...
...enslaved.
Not for work, you understand...
...but for sport.
Caging skin-changers...
...and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.
There are others like you?
Once there were many.
And now?
Now there is only one.
You need to reach...
...the mountain before
the last days of autumn.
Before Durin's Day falls.
Yes.
You are running out of time.
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.
A darkness lies upon that forest.
Fell things creep beneath those trees.
There is an alliance
between the Orcs of Moria...
...and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.
I would not venture there...
...except in great need.
We will take the Elven Road.
That path is still safe.
"Safe"?
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...
...are not like their kin.
They're less wise...
...and more dangerous.
But it matters not.
What do you mean?
These lands are crawling with Orcs.
Their numbers are growing.
And you are on foot.
You will never reach...
...the forest alive.
I don't like Dwarves.
They're greedy...
...and blind.
Blind to the lives of those they deem...
...lesser than their own.
But Orcs I hate more.
What do you need?
Go now. While you have the light.
Your hunters are not far behind.
The Elven Gate.
Here lies our path...
...through Mirkwood.
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.
Set the ponies loose.
Let them return to their master.
This forest...
...feels...
...sick.
As if a disease lies upon it.
Is there no way around?
Not unless we go 200 miles north.
Or twice that distance...
...south.
Something moves in the shadows unseen...
...hidden from our sight.
Every day it grows in strength.
Beware the Necromancer.
He is not what he seems.
If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.
Go to the tombs in the mountains.
The High Fells.
So be it.
Not my horse!
I need it!
You're not leaving us?
I would not do this unless I had to.
You've changed...
...Bilbo Baggins.
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.
I was going to tell you.
I...
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.
Found what?
What did you find?
My courage.
Good. Well, that's good.
You'll need it.
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...
...the slopes of Erebor.
Keep the map and key safe.
Do not enter that mountain without me.
This is not the Greenwood of old.
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.
"Lead us astray"?
What does that mean?
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.
If you do, you'll never...
...find it again.
No matter what may come, stay on...
...the path!
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.
- Durin's Day?
- Let's go.
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.
The path turns this way.
This way.
Air. I need air.
My head, it's swimming!
What's happening?
Keep moving.
Nori...
...why have we stopped?
The path...
...it's disappeared.
What's going on?
We've lost the path!
Find it.
All of you, look. Look for the path!
I don't remember this bit.
None of it's familiar.
It's got to be here.
What hour is it?
I do not know. I do not even know
what day it is.
Is there no end to this accursed forest?!
Attercop.
Look.
A tobacco pouch.
There's Dwarves in these woods.
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains,
no less.
This is exactly the same as mine.
Because it is yours. Do you understand?
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.
We are not lost. We keep heading east.
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.
I thought you were the expert.
The sun.
We have to find...
...the sun.
Up there.
We need to...
...get above the canopy.
What was that?
Enough! Quiet! All of you!
We're being watched.
I can see a lake!
And a river.
And the Lonely Mountain.
We're almost there!
Can you hear me?
I know which way to go!
Hello?
Hello.
Oh, no.
Oh, come on.
Kill them! Kill them.
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.
Stick it again.
Stick it again. Finish it off.
The meat's alive and kicking!
Kill him.
Kill him now.
Let us feast.
Feast! Feast!
Feast! Feast!
Eat them alive!
Feast!
- What is it?
- What is it?
Eat them alive!
Fat and juicy.
Just a...
...little taste.
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!
Here.
Ah! It stings!
It stings!
Sting.
That's a good name.
Sting.
You all right there, Bofur?
- I'm all right!
- Get it off me!
Where's Bilbo?
I'm up here!
Grab the legs!
Pull!
Pull!
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.
Where is it?
No!
No! No!
Thorin! Get them!
Come on!
Look out, brother!
Fili!
Mine.
Come on...
...keep up!
We're clear!
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.
It would be my pleasure.
- Help!
- Kili!
Throw me a dagger!
Quick!
If you think I'm giving you...
...a weapon, Dwarf...
...you're mistaken!
Search them.
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!
Who is this?
- Your brother?
- That is...
...my wife!
And what is this horrid creature?
A Goblin-mutant?
That's my wee lad, Gimli.
Where did you get this?
It was given to me.
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.
Thorin, where's Bilbo?
Unh! This is not the end of it!
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!
Get off me!
Aren't you going to search me?
I could have anything down my trousers.
Or nothing.
- Again!
- Leave it!
There's no way out!
This is no Orc dungeon.
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.
A quest to reclaim a homeland...
...and slay a dragon.
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.
Attempted burglary.
Or something of that ilk.
You have found...
...a way in.
You seek that which would...
...bestow upon you the right to rule.
The King's Jewel.
The Arkenstone.
It is precious to you beyond measure.
I understand that.
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.
White gems...
...of pure starlight.
I offer you my help.
I am listening.
I will let you go...
...if you but return what is mine.
A favor for a favor.
You have my word.
One king to another.
I would not trust Thranduil...
...the great king...
...to honor his word...
...should the end of all days
be upon us!
You...
...who lack all...
...honor!
I have seen how you treat your friends.
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...
...seeking your help.
But you turned your back!
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...
...and the inferno that destroyed us.
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.
I know...
...its wrath and ruin.
I have faced...
...the great serpents of the North.
I warned your...
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.
But he would not listen.
You are just like him.
Stay here if you will...
...and rot.
A hundred years is a mere blink...
...in the life of an Elf.
I'm patient.
I can wait.
Did he offer you a deal?
He did.
I told him he could go
sh kakhf ai-'d dr-rugnu!
Him and all his kin!
Well, that's that, then.
A deal was our only hope.
Not our only hope.
I know you're there.
Why do you linger in the shadows?
I was coming to report to you.
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.
We cleared...
...the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...
...coming up from the South.
They are spawning in...
...the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...
That fortress lies beyond our borders.
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.
And when we drive them off, what then?
Will they not spread to other lands?
Other lands are not my concern.
The fortunes of the world...
...will rise and fall.
But here in this...
...kingdom, we will endure.
Legolas said you fought well today.
He has grown very fond of you.
I assure you, my lord...
...Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.
Perhaps he did once.
Now I am not so sure.
I do not think you would allow your son...
...to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.
No, you are right. I would not.
Still, he cares about you.
Do not give him hope where there is none.
The stone in your hand, what is it?
It is a talisman.
A powerful spell lies upon it.
If any but a Dwarf
reads the runes on this stone...
...they will be forever cursed.
Or not.
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.
A rune stone.
My mother...
...gave it to me
so I'd remember my promise.
What promise?
That I would come back to her.
She worries.
She thinks I'm reckless.
Are you?
Nah.
Sounds like quite a party...
...you're having up there.
It is Mereth e-nGilith...
...the Feast of Starlight.
All light is sacred to the Eldar.
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.
I always thought it is a cold light.
Remote and far away.
It is memory...
...precious and pure.
Like your promise.
I have walked there sometimes.
Beyond the forest...
...and up into the night.
I have seen the world fall away...
...and the white light
of forever fill the air.
I saw a fire moon once.
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...
...trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...
...keeping the mountain to our left.
And then it appeared.
This huge fire moon...
...lighting our path.
I wish I could show you the caverns.
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.
The bargeman will be waiting for them.
Say what you like about our...
...ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.
Come, Elros, try it.
I have the Dwarves...
...in my charge.
They're locked up.
Where can they go? Ha, ha.
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.
Must be nearly dawn.
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?
Not stuck in here, you're not.
Bilbo!
What?
Shh! There are guards nearby!
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.
- Up the stairs.
- You first.
Ori.
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.
Go.
Easy, now.
This way.
Come on.
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!
I know what I'm doing!
Shh!
This way! This way!
Everyone...
- ...climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?
- They'll find us.
- No, no.
They won't, I promise you.
Please, please. You must trust me.
Do as he says.
Move your big ginger head.
Bifur, get in...
...the barrel! Move!
Everyone's in.
What do we do now?
Hold your breath.
Hold my breath? What do you mean?
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?
Well done, Master Baggins.
Go! Come on, let's go!
Hold on!
Bilbo!
Hang on!
- Help!
- Ori!
No!
Watch out! There's Orcs!
Get under the bridge!
Kili!
Kili!
Kili.
Kili!
Nori!
Cut the log!
Bombur!
Tauriel.
Oh, it's you!
Why am I here, Gandalf?
Trust me, Radagast.
I would not have called you here
without good reason.
This is not a nice place to meet.
No.
It is not.
These are dark spells, Gandalf.
Old and full of hate.
Who's buried here?
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.
He would have been known only...
...as a servant of evil.
One of a number.
One of nine.
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.
The Ringwraiths...
...have been summoned to Dol Guldur.
But it cannot be the Necromancer.
A human sorcerer
could not summon such evil.
Who said it was human?
The Nine only answer to one master.
We've been blind, Radagast.
And in our blindness...
...the Enemy has returned.
He is summoning his servants.
Azog the Defiler...
...is no ordinary hunter.
He is a commander.
A commander of legions.
The Enemy is preparing for war.
It will begin in the East.
His mind is set upon that mountain.
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.
Gandalf.
I started this. I cannot forsake them.
They are in grave danger.
If what you say is true...
...the world is in grave danger.
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.
You want me to cast my friends aside?
- Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see.
- I think we've outrun the Orcs.
- Not for long. We've lost the current.
Bombur's half drowned.
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.
Come on, let's go!
Gloin, help me, my brother.
Come on, lift yourself.
Come on!
Come on, you big lump, you!
I'm fine. It's nothing.
On your feet.
Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.
To where?
To the mountain. We're so close.
A lake lies between us and that mountain.
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.
Bind his leg, quickly.
You have two minutes.
Do it again...
...and you're dead.
Excuse me...
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.
That barge over there...
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?
What makes you think I would help you?
Those boots have seen better days.
As has that coat.
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.
How many bairns?
A boy and two girls.
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.
Aye.
She was.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.
What's your hurry?
What's it to you?
I would like to know who you are...
...and what you are doing in these lands.
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...
...journeying to see our kin...
...in the Iron Hills.
Simple merchants, you say?
We need food...
...supplies, weapons.
Can you help us?
I know where these...
...barrels came from.
What of it?
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...
...but I don't think it ended well.
No one enters Lake-town...
...but by leave of the Master.
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.
Offer him more.
I'll wager there are...
...ways to enter that town unseen.
Aye.
But for that...
...you would need a smuggler.
For which we would pay double.
Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in...
...the vast ignorance of the world...
...it festers and spreads.
A shadow that grows in the dark.
A sleepless malice as black...
...as the oncoming wall of night.
So it ever was.
So will it always be.
In time, all foul things come forth.
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.
Why?
Not 13.
Not anymore.
The young one...
...the black-haired archer...
...we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...
...choking on it soon.
Answer the question, filth.
I would not antagonize her.
You like killing things, Orc?
You like death?
Then let me give it to you.
I do not care about one...
...dead Dwarf. Answer the question.
You have nothing to fear. Tell us...
...what you know
and I will set you free.
You had orders to kill them. Why?
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?
The Dwarf runt will never be king.
King?
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.
None would dare enter Erebor...
...whilst the dragon lives.
You know nothing.
Your world will burn.
What are you talking about?
Speak!
Our time has come again.
My master serves the One.
Do you understand now, Elfling?
Death is upon you.
The flames of war...
...are upon you.
Why did you do that?
You promised to set him free.
And I did.
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.
There was more...
...the Orc could tell us.
There was nothing more he could tell me.
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...
...it will destroy all before it.
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.
No one enters this kingdom.
And no one leaves it.
Watch out!
What are you trying...
...to do, drown us?
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.
If I wanted to drown you...
...I would not do it here.
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?
Uh, I asked him.
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.
We do not have to like him.
We simply have to pay him.
Come on now, lads. Turn out...
...your pockets.
How do we know he won't betray us?
We don't.
There's...
...just a wee problem.
We're 10 coins short.
Gloin.
Come on.
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.
I have been bled dry...
...by this venture.
What have I seen...
...for my investment?
Naught but misery and...
...grief and...
Bless my beard.
Take it.
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.
The money, quick. Give it to me.
We will pay you when we...
...get our provisions but not before.
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.
There are guards ahead.
What's he doing?
He's talking to someone.
He's pointing right at us.
Now they're...
...shaking hands.
- What?
- The villain.
He's selling us out.
Quiet.
We're approaching the tollgate.
Halt!
Goods inspection!
Papers, please!
Oh, it's you, Bard.
Morning, Percy.
Anything to declare?
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...
...and ready for home.
You and me both.
There we are.
All in order.
Not so fast.
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm."
Only...
...they're not empty...
...are they, Bard?
If I recall correctly...
...you're licensed as a bargeman.
Not...
...a fisherman.
That's none of your business.
Wrong.
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.
These fish are illegal.
Empty the barrels...
- ...over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.
Come on. Get a move on.
Folk in this town are struggling.
Times are hard.
Food is scarce.
That's not my problem.
And when the people hear
the Master is dumping fish...
...back in the lake...
...when the rioting starts...
...will it be your problem then?
Stop.
Ever the people's champion...
...eh, Bard? Protector of...
...the common folk.
You might have their favor now,
bargeman...
...but it won't last.
Raise the gate!
The Master has his eye on you.
You'd do well to remember:
We know where you live.
It's a small town, Alfrid.
Everyone knows where everyone lives.
All this talk of civil unrest.
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.
Gout playing up, sire?
It's the damp.
It's the only possible explanation.
Get me a brandy.
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.
It's not my fault they live in a place...
...that stinks of fish oil and tar.
Jobs, shelter, food.
It's all they ever bleat about.
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.
Then we must find these...
...troublemakers and arrest them.
My thoughts exactly, sire.
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.
Can't afford to let the rabble
band together...
...and start making noises.
The next thing...
...you know, they'll start
asking questions...
...forming committees...
...launching inquiries.
Out with the old, in with the new?
What?
That's what they've been saying, sire.
There is even talk...
...of an election.
An election? Heh.
That's absurd.
I won't stand for it. Ha!
I don't think they'd ask
you to stand, sire.
Shirkers.
Ingrates.
Rabble-rousers.
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?
Who would dare?
Who...?
Bard.
You mark my words:
That trouble-making bargeman...
...is behind all this.
Get your hands off me.
You didn't see them.
They were never here.
The fish you can have for nothing.
Follow me.
Da!
Our house, it's being watched.
You can tell the Master
I'm done...
...for the day.
Da! Where have you been?
Father! There you are! I was worried.
Here, Sigrid.
Bain, get them in.
If you speak of this to anyone...
...I'll rip your arms off.
Get off.
Up there.
Da...
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?
Will they bring us luck?
They may not be the best fit...
...but they'll keep you warm.
Thank you very much.
A Dwarvish windlance.
You look like...
...you've seen a ghost.
He has.
The last time we saw...
...such a weapon...
...a city was on fire.
It was the day the dragon came.
The day that Smaug...
...destroyed Dale.
Girion, the Lord of the City...
...rallied his bowmen...
...to fire upon the beast.
But a dragon's hide is tough.
Tougher than the strongest armor.
Only a Black Arrow fired
from a windlance...
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.
And few of those...
...arrows were ever made.
The store was running low...
...when Girion...
...made his last stand.
Had the aim of Men been true that day...
...much would have been different.
You speak as if you were there.
All Dwarves know the tale.
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.
He loosened a scale under the left wing.
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.
That's a fairy story, lad.
Nothing more.
You took our money.
Where are the weapons?
Wait here.
Tomorrow begins...
...the last days of autumn.
Durin's Day falls the morn after next.
We must reach the mountain before then.
And if we do not?
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?
Then this quest has been for nothing.
What is this?
Pike hook.
Made from an old harpoon.
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.
It's heavy in hand, I grant...
...but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.
We paid...
...you for weapons.
Iron-forged swords...
...and axes!
It's a joke!
You won't find...
...better outside the city armory.
All iron-forged weapons are held there...
...under lock and key.
Thorin...
...why not take what's...
...on offer and go?
I've made do with less.
So have you.
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.
What did you say?
There are spies watching this house...
...and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.
You must wait...
...till nightfall.
Thorin.
Da?
Don't let them leave.
Tauriel...
...you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...
...on your own.
But I'm not on my own.
You knew I would come.
The king is angry...
...Tauriel. For 600 years...
...my father has protected you,
favored you.
You defied his orders.
You betrayed his trust.
The king has never let Orc filth...
...roam our lands.
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.
It is not our fight.
It is our fight.
It will not end here.
With every victory, this evil will grow.
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.
We will hide within our walls...
...live our lives away from the light...
...and let darkness descend.
Are we not part of this world?
Tell me, mellon.
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?
Hello, Bard. What you after?
There was a tapestry!
An old one! Where's it gone?
What tapestry you talking about?
This one.
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared...
...out of nowhere.
Full beards. Fierce eyes.
I've never seen the like.
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.
Prophecy.
Prophecy.
The old tales will come true.
Vast halls of treasure!
Can it really be true?
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?
The lord of the silver fountains
The King of carven stone
The King beneath the mountain
Shall come into his own!
And the bell shall ring in gladness
At the Mountain
King's return
But all shall fail in sadness
And the lake will shine and burn
Da, I tried to stop them.
How long have they been gone?
- Can you see anything?
- Shh! Keep it down.
As soon as we have the
weapons, we make straight for the mountain.
Go, go, go.
Go, Nori.
Next.
You all right?
I can manage.
Let's just get out of here.
Run!
Quickly! Move now!
Get off me! Get off!
Move them along here.
Move on!
What is the meaning of this?
- We caught them stealing weapons, sire.
- Ah.
Enemies of the state, eh?
A desperate bunch of...
...mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.
Hold your tongue!
You do not know to whom you speak.
This is no common criminal.
This is Thorin...
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.
We have come to reclaim our homeland.
I remember this town
in the great days of old.
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...
...filled with silks and fine gems.
This was no forsaken town on a lake.
This was the center of all trade
in the North!
I would...
...see those days return.
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...
...and send wealth and riches...
...flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!
Death!
That is what you will...
...bring upon us!
Dragon fire and ruin.
If you waken that beast...
...it will destroy us all.
You can listen to this naysayer...
...but I promise you this:
If we succeed...
...all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...
...10 times over!
All of you!
Listen to me!
You must listen!
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?
Have you forgotten those...
...who died in the firestorm?!
And for what purpose?
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...
...so riven by greed, he could not...
...see beyond his own desire!
Now, now!
We must not, any of us...
...be too quick to lay blame.
Let us...
...not forget that it was...
...Girion, Lord of Dale...
...your ancestor...
...who failed to kill the beast!
It's true, sire.
We all know the story.
Arrow after arrow, he shot.
Each one missing its mark.
You have no right.
No right to enter that mountain.
I have the only right.
I speak to the Master...
...of the Men of the Lake.
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?
Will you...
...share in the great wealth
of our people?
What say you?
I say unto you...
Welcome!
Welcome!
And thrice...
...welcome...
...King Under the Mountain!
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.
If we're to find the door before...
...nightfall, we can risk no more delays.
Not you.
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.
Not now.
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.
Kili, stay here.
Rest.
Join us when you're healed.
I'll stay with the lad.
My duty lies with the wounded.
Uncle.
We grew up on tales of the mountain.
Tales you told us.
You cannot take that away...
- ...from him!
- Fili.
I will carry him if I must!
One day you will be king
and you will understand.
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one Dwarf.
Not even my own kin.
Fili, don't be a fool.
You belong with the company.
I belong with my brother.
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!
Go now with our goodwill...
...and good wishes.
- And may your return bring good fortune...
- Wait!
...to all!
Goodbye.
Out of the way!
No! No!
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?
Kili? Kili!
No.
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.
No, no...
...no! Please!
No one will help us. Kili's sick.
He's very sick.
What is this place?
It was once the city of Dale.
Now it is a ruin.
The desolation of Smaug.
The sun will soon reach midday.
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.
This way.
Wait. Is this the overlook?
Gandalf said to meet him here.
- On no account were we to...
- Do you see him?
We have no time...
...to wait upon the Wizard.
We're on our own. Come!
Dol Guldur.
The Hill of Sorcery.
It looks completely abandoned.
As it is meant to.
A spell of concealment...
...lies over this place, which means...
...our Enemy is not yet ready
to reveal himself.
He has not regained his full strength.
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.
Tell her we must force his hand.
What do you mean?
I'm going in alone.
On no account come after me.
Do I have your word?
Yes, yes, yes!
Wait, Gandalf!
What if it's a trap?!
Turn around and do not come back.
It's undoubtedly a trap.
Anything?
Nothing!
If the map is true...
...then the hidden door
lies directly above us.
Up here!
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.
This must be it.
The hidden door.
Let all those who doubted us...
...rue this day!
Right, then. We have a key.
Which means that somewhere...
...there is a key-hole.
"The last light of Durin's Day...
...will shine upon...
...the key-hole."
Nori.
We're losing the light. Come on.
Be quiet! I can't
hear when you're thumping.
I can't find it.
It's not here!
It's not here!
- Break it down!
- Aye.
Come on!
Break!
It has to break.
It's no good.
The door's sealed. Can't
be opened by force.
There's a powerful magic on it.
No!
"The last light of Durin's Day...
...will shine upon the key-hole."
That is what it says.
What did we miss?
What did we miss?
Balin?
We've lost the light.
There's no more to be done.
We had but...
...one chance.
Come away, lads.
It's over.
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.
Where are they going?
You can't give up now!
Thorin.
You can't give up now.
"Stand by the gray stone...
...when the thrush knocks."
The setting sun.
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine..."
The last light.
Last light.
The last light!
The key-hole!
Come back!
Come back!
It's the light of the moon! The last...
...moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the...?
It was here.
Come on, it was... It was here.
It was just...
Erebor.
Thorin.
I know these walls.
These halls.
This stone.
You remember it...
...Balin.
Chambers filled with golden light.
I remember.
"Herein lies...
...the Seventh Kingdom of...
...Durin's Folk.
May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...
...Dwarves in defense of this home."
The Throne of the King.
Ah.
And what's that above it?
The Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
And what's that?
That, Master Burglar...
...is why you are here.
Can you not do something?
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.
Pigs?
Weed.
Right.
Don't move.
You want me to find a jewel?
A large, white jewel.
Yes.
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.
There is only one Arkenstone...
...and you'll know it when you see it.
Right.
In truth...
...lad...
...I do not know...
...what you will find down there.
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.
No, Balin.
I promised I would do this...
...and I think I must try.
It never ceases to amaze me.
What's that?
The courage of Hobbits.
Go now...
...with as much luck as you can muster.
Oh, Bilbo?
If there is, in fact...
...a live dragon...
...down there...
...don't waken it.
Where is your master?
Where is he?!
Sauron!
Hello?
He's not at home.
Not at home. Ahem.
Good.
Good, good, good.
What's that?
Shush. Shush.
Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
A large, white jewel.
Very helpful.
Well...
...thief.
I smell you.
I hear your breath.
I feel...
...your air.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Come, now...
...don't be shy.
Step into the light.
Hmm.
There is something about you.
Something you...
...carry.
Something made of gold.
But far more...
...precious.
Precious! Precious!
There you are...
...Thief in the...
...Shadows.
I did not come to steal from you...
...O Smaug...
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...
...to gaze upon your magnificence.
To see...
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.
I did not believe them.
And do you now?!
Truly...
...the tales and songs...
...fall utterly short of your enormity...
...O Smaug the Stupendous.
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?
No, no.
No, indeed.
You seem familiar with my name...
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.
Who are you...
...and where do you come from...
...may I ask?
I come from under the hill.
Underhill?
And under hills...
...and over hills my path has led.
And... And...
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.
Impressive.
What else do you claim to be?
I am...
Luck-wearer.
Riddle-maker.
Lovely titles.
Go on.
Barrel-rider.
Barrels? Now that is interesting.
And what about...
...your little Dwarf friends?
Where are they hiding?
Dwarves?
No.
No, no. No Dwarves here.
You've got that all wrong.
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!
They sent you in here...
...to do their dirty work while they...
...skulk about outside.
Truly...
...you are mistaken...
...O Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.
You have nice manners...
...for a thief and...
...a liar!
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.
No one better!
It is the gold!
They are drawn...
...to treasure like...
...flies to dead flesh.
Did you think I did not know...
...this day would come?!
That a pack of...
...canting Dwarves...
...would come crawling back...
...to the mountain?!
Was that an earthquake?
That, my lad...
...was a dragon.
Da?
It's coming from the mountain.
You should leave us.
Take your children.
Get out of here.
And go where?
There is nowhere to go.
Are we going to die, Da?
No, darling.
The dragon.
It's going to kill us.
Not if I kill it first.
The King Under the Mountain is dead.
I took his throne.
I ate his...
...people like a wolf among sheep.
I kill where...
...I wish, when...
...I wish.
My armor is iron.
No blade can pierce me.
All right.
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me?
Because you did not need to know.
Listen to me carefully.
I need you to distract the guards.
Once I'm at the top of...
...the tower, I'll set
the arrow to the bow.
There he is!
Bard!
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop!
Bain! Bain.
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!
Braga.
You're under arrest.
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.
Where's he gone?
What about Bilbo?
Give him more time.
Time to do what? To be killed?
You're afraid.
Yes, I'm afraid.
I fear for you.
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.
A sickness which drove...
...your grandfather mad.
I am not my grandfather.
You're not yourself.
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...
I will not risk...
...this quest for the life of one burglar.
Bilbo.
His name is Bilbo.
It's Oakenshield...
...that filthy Dwarvish usurper.
He sent you in here...
...for the Arkenstone, didn't he?
No. No...
...no. I don't know
what you're talking about.
Don't bother denying it.
I guessed his foul purpose
some time ago.
But it matters not.
Oakenshield's quest will fail.
The darkness is coming.
It will spread to every corner of the land.
You are being used, Thief...
...in the Shadows.
You were only...
...ever a means to an end.
The coward...
...Oakenshield has weighed...
...the value of your life...
...and found it worth nothing.
No.
No.
No, you're lying.
What did he promise you?
A share of the treasure?
As if it was his...
...to give.
I will not part with...
...a single coin.
Not one piece of it.
My teeth...
...are swords.
My claws are spears.
My wings...
...are a hurricane.
So it is true.
The Black Arrow found its mark.
What did you say?
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...
...the Tyrannical.
Truly.
You have no equal on this earth.
I am...
...almost tempted to let you take it.
If only to see Oakenshield...
...suffer.
Watch it...
...destroy him.
Watch it corrupt his heart...
...and drive him mad.
But I think not.
I think our little game ends here.
So tell me...
...thief...
...how do you choose to die?
Nah.
Da? Is that you, Da?
- Aah!
- Stay down!
Get down!
You killed them all.
There are others.
Tauriel.
Come.
We're losing him.
Tauriel.
Athelas.
Athelas.
What are you doing?
I'm going to save him.
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.
- The dragon's coming.
Did you find it?
We have to get out.
Thorin.
Thorin.
You will burn!
- Run!
- Ah!
Come on, Bilbo!
Come on.
Hold him down.
Unh! Tilda.
Shh, shh, shh!
We've given him the slip.
No.
He's too cunning for that.
So where to now?
The western guardroom.
There may be a way out.
It's too high. There's no chance...
- ...that way.
- It's our only chance.
We have to try.
Come on.
I've heard tell of
the wonders of Elvish medicine.
That was a privilege to witness.
Tauriel.
Lie still.
You cannot be her.
She is far away.
She is far...
...far away from me.
She walks...
...in starlight in another world.
It was just a dream.
Do you think she could've loved me?
Stay close.
That's it, then.
There's no way out.
The last of our kin.
They must have come here...
...hoping...
...beyond hope.
We could try to reach the mines.
We might last a few days.
No.
I will not die like this.
Cowering.
Clawing for breath.
We make for the forges.
He'll see us, sure as death.
Not if we split up.
Thorin...
...we'll never make it.
Some of us might.
Lead him to the forges.
We kill the dragon.
If this is to end in fire...
...then we will all burn together.
This way.
Flee.
Flee.
Run for your lives.
There is...
...nowhere to hide.
Behind you!
Worm!
Come on!
Run!
Hey, you!
Here!
This way. It's this way!
Come on!
Thorin!
Follow Balin!
- Thorin.
- Come on!
Thorin!
Hold on!
Thorin!
Go. Go!
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.
He's right. We've no...
...fire hot enough to set them ablaze.
Have we not?
I did not look to see you
so easily outwitted.
You have grown...
...slow and fat...
...in your dotage...
...slug!
Take cover. Go!
Bombur!
Get those bellows working.
Go!
Bilbo!
Up there. On my mark...
...pull that lever.
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!
We don't have a jiffy.
Where's the sulfur?
You sure you know what...
...you're doing?
Come on!
Now!
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.
Keep going, Bilbo!
Run!
You think you...
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?
You have come from Lake-town.
This is some...
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.
Those sniveling cowards...
...with their long bows...
...and Black Arrows.
Perhaps it is time...
...I paid them a visit.
Oh, no.
This isn't their fault!
Wait!
You cannot go to Lake-town!
You care about them...
...do you?
Good.
Then you can...
...watch them die.
Here!
You witless worm.
You.
I am taking back what you stole.
You...
...will take nothing...
...from me...
...Dwarf.
I laid low your warriors...
...of old.
I instilled terror in...
...the hearts of Men.
I am...
...King Under...
...the Mountain.
This is not your kingdom.
These are Dwarf lands.
This is Dwarf gold.
And we will...
...have our revenge.
Revenge?!
Revenge?!
I will show you revenge!
Listen to me!
Do you not know what is coming?
I am fire.
I am...
...death.
What have we done?


I warned you.
Did I not warn you what would come
of dealing with Dwarves?
Now they've done it.
They've woken the dragon!
They've brought an apocalypse
upon our heads!
Come on. Quickly.
Quickly.
Faster now...
...I'm trying to evacuate.
Careful, man.
Never mind the books. Get on!
But, sire, should
we not try to save the town?
The town is lost.
- Save the gold!
- You heard him. Get a move on.
- Da!
- Come on.
Pile them up!
We have no time. We must leave.
- Get him up.
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm fine. I can walk.
- Fast as you can.
- We're not leaving.
Not without our father.
If you stay here, your sisters will die.
Is that what your father would want?
Open...
...this door!
Do you hear me?
I can see him!
Look!
Down here! Now!
- Give me your hand.
- We gotta go.
Quickly now. Hurry.
Kili, come on!
- It's around the corner!
- Keep on going, man!
Dragon!
Page 2/39

Come on, come on!
Faster! Faster!
If only we could take...
...more of these people with us,
but they're hardly...
- Worth it. I quite agree.
- Help!
Help!
Look out!
Move it!
Move it!
Come on! Faster!
My gold! My gold!
We're carrying too much.
We need to dump something.
Quite right...
...Alfrid.
Faster! Faster!
Poor souls.
Da.
Da!
He hit it!
- He hit the dragon! He did!
- No.
He hit his mark! I saw.
His arrows cannot pierce its hide.
I fear nothing will.
What are you doing?
- Come back! Bain!
- Bain!
Bain!
Get back here!
- Bain!
- Leave him.
We cannot go back.
Bain!
Dad.
Bain! What are you doing?
You were supposed to leave!
- I came to help you.
- No!
Nothing can stop it now.
This might.
Bain.
Page 3/39

You go back.
You get out of here. Now.
Dad!
Bain!
Stop, stop! Halt!
Halt!
Who are you...
...that would stand...
...against me?
Now, that is a pity.
What will you do now...
...Bowman?
You are...
...forsaken.
No help will come.
Now's our chance! Go!
Go!
Head for the open water!
Hmm.
Is that...
...your child?
You cannot...
...save him from the fire.
He will...
...burn!
Stay still, son.
Stay still.
Tell me...
...wretch...
...how now shall you challenge me?
You have nothing left...
...but your...
...death!
Bain.
Look at me.
You look at me.
Little to your left.
That's it.
Bain! Hold on!
What was that?
What happened?
It fell. I saw it.
It's dead.
Smaug is dead.
Page 4/39

By my beard...
...I think he's right.
Look there!
The Ravens of Erebor
are returning to the Mountain.
Aye.
Word will spread.
Before long...
...every soul in Middle-earth will know...
...the dragon is dead!
You are not...
...alone...
...Mithrandir.
Help me!
Where's my baby?
Please!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Over there!
Da!
Da!
- Da!
- Da!
Aah! Why me?
Tauriel.
Kili!
Come on.
We're leaving!
They are your people. You must go.
Come with me.
I know how I feel. I'm not afraid.
You make me feel alive.
I can't.
Tauriel.
I don't know what that means.
I think you do.
One more!
Keep it.
As a promise.
These are dry. You'll need them.
- Thank you.
- Here.
Oi! Give me one of them.
I'll catch my death...
Page 5/39

...in this cold.
Find your own!
You're not in charge,
Alfrid Lickspittle.
You are wrong.
In the absence of the Master...
...the power cedes to his deputy...
...which in this instance is my good self.
Now give me that blanket!
Master's deputy?
Don't make me laugh.
You're a sneak-thief.
I'll be dead before...
...I answer to you.
Maybe that can be arranged.
I wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid.
Not now.
- Da!
- Come here!
You're alive.
It's all right, darling.
It was Bard! He killed the dragon!
I saw it with me own eyes.
He brought the beast down!
Shot him dead...
...with a Black Arrow.
Thank you, Bard!
- Good man.
- Thank you!
You've saved us all!
Bless you.
All hail to the Dragon-Slayer!
All hail...
...King Bard!
I have said it many times.
This is a man of noble stock.
- A born leader!
- Do not call me that.
I'm not Master...
...of this town.
Where is he?
- Where's the Master?
- Halfway down the Anduin.
With all our coin, I don't doubt.
Page 6/39

You would know.
You helped him empty...
- ...the treasury.
- No.
I tried to stop him.
- Liar!
- Cheat!
You're a mongrel!
I begged. I pleaded.
Away with him!
- Tar him!
- I said, "Master...
...no!
Think of the children."
Hang him!
"Will nobody think of the children?"
Ow!
To the tree with him!
- Hang him hard!
- Take him down!
Enough! Let him go!
Let him go!
Look around you!
Have you not...
...had your fill of death?
Winter is upon us.
We must look to our own.
To the sick and the helpless.
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.
Those who have strength, follow me.
We must salvage what we can.
What then? What'll we do then?
We find shelter.
Hello!
Bombur?
Bifur?
Anybody?
Wait!
Wait!
- It's Bilbo!
- He's alive!
Stop! Stop!
Stop.
Page 7/39

You need to leave.
We all need to leave.
We only just got here.
I've tried talking, but he won't listen.
- What do you mean, laddie?
- Thorin!
Thorin. Thorin.
He's been down there for days.
He doesn't sleep. He barely eats.
He's not been himself. Not at all.
It's this place. Ahem.
I think a sickness lies on it.
Sickness?
What kind of sickness?
Fili.
Fili!
Fili!
Gold.
Gold beyond measure.
Beyond sorrow...
...and grief.
Behold...
...the great...
...treasure hoard of Thror.
Welcome...
...my sister-sons...
...to the Kingdom...
...of Erebor.
Balin!
Kili!
Thank Durin, you're alive.
Bombur!
You're alive!
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing yet.
Nothing here.
- Keep searching!
- That jewel could be anywhere.
The Arkenstone is in these halls.
- Find it!
- You heard him.
- Keep looking.
- All of you!
No one rests until...
Page 8/39

...it is found.
I am almost tempted...
...to let you take it.
If only...
...to see Oakenshield...
...suffer.
Watch it...
...destroy him.
Watch it corrupt...
...his heart...
...and drive him mad.
I've got you.
Take only what you need.
We have a long march ahead.
Where will you go?
There is only one place.
The Mountain.
You are a genius, sire.
We can take refuge inside the Mountain.
It might smell a bit of dragon,
but the women can clean that up.
It'll be safe and warm and dry...
...and full of stores...
...bedding, clothing...
...the odd bit of gold.
What gold is in that Mountain is cursed.
We will take only
what was promised to us.
Only what we need to rebuild...
...our lives.
Here. Pull your weight.
News of the death of Smaug
will have spread through the lands.
Aye.
Others will now look to the Mountain...
...for its wealth...
...for its position.
What is it you know?
Nothing for certain.
It's what I fear may come.
You saw something out there.
The Orc I pursued out of Lake-town,
I know who he is.
Bolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler.
Page 9/39

A Warg pack was waiting for him
on the outskirts of Esgaroth.
They fled into the North.
These Orcs were different
from the others.
They bore a mark
I have not seen for a long time.
The mark of Gundabad.
Gundabad?
An Orc stronghold...
...in the far North of the Misty Mountains.
You may tell my father...
...if there is no place for Tauriel,
there is no place for me.
Legolas.
It is your king's command.
I ride North. Will you come with me?
To where?
To Gundabad.
I come for Mithrandir...
...and I will leave with him.
If you try to stop me...
...I will destroy you.
Nine...
...for mortal Men doomed to die.
I am not alone.
Are you in need of assistance, my lady?
You should've stayed...
...dead.
Mithrandir...
...come back.
He is here.
Yes.
The darkness has returned.
Go on!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Climb on!
He is weak.
He cannot remain here.
It is draining his life.
Go!
Quickly!
Come with me, my lady.
Page 10/39

Go!
You have no...
...power here...
...servant of Morgoth.
You...
...are nameless.
Faceless.
Formless.
Go back to the void...
...from whence you came!
The spirit of Sauron endured.
And has been banished.
He will flee into the East.
Gondor...
...should be warned.
They must set a watch
on the walls of Mordor.
No.
Look after the Lady Galadriel.
She has spent much of her power.
Her strength is failing.
Take her to Lothlrien.
My Lord Saruman.
He must be hunted down...
...and destroyed once and for all.
Without the Ring of Power...
...Sauron can never again
hold dominion over Middle-earth.
Go now.
Leave Sauron to me.
- I need that horse.
- What?
- Gandalf, where are you going?
- To warn Erebor.
They have no idea what is coming.
I saw them...
...with my own eyes,
rank upon rank of Moria Orcs.
You must summon our friends,
bird and beast.
The battle for the Mountain
is about to begin.
Wait.
Take this.
Page 11/39

If what you say is true,
then you'll need it more than I.
Thank you.
A word of warning, eh?
It can be a bit dicky sometimes.
You just have to twiddle with the top.
I expect you'll manage.
It is here in these halls.
I know it.
We have searched and searched.
Not well enough.
Thorin, we all would see
the stone returned.
And yet, it is still not found!
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?
The Arkenstone...
...is the birthright of our people.
It is The King's Jewel.
Am I not the king?
Know this:
If anyone should find it...
...and withhold it from me...
...I will be avenged.
Dragon-sickness.
I've seen it before.
That look.
The terrible need.
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.
It sent his grandfather mad.
Balin, if Thorin...
...had the Arkenstone...
...or if...
...it was found...
...would it help?
That stone crowns all.
It is the summit of this great wealth...
...bestowing power...
...upon he who bears it.
Would it stay his madness?
No, laddie.
I fear it would make him worse.
Perhaps it is best...
...it remains lost.
Page 12/39

What is that?
In your hand.
It's nothing.
Show me.
It...
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.
You've carried it all this way?
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.
In Bag End.
It's a poor prize to
take back to the Shire.
One day, it'll grow.
And every time I look at it, I'll remember.
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...
...and how lucky I am that I made it home.
Thorin, I...
Thorin.
Survivors from Lake-town...
...they're streaming into Dale.
There's hundreds of them.
Call everyone to the gate.
To the gate!
Now!
Come on.
- Keep moving.
- Sire!
Sire!
Up here!
Look, sire! The braziers are lit.
So...
...the Company of Thorin Oakenshield
survived.
Survived?
There's a bunch of Dwarves
with all that gold?
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid.
There's gold enough
in that Mountain for all.
Make camp here tonight!
Find what shelter you can.
Get some fires going.
- Come on, hurry along now.
- Alfrid.
Page 13/39

You'll take...
...the night watch.
Up it goes!
That's it.
I want this fortress made safe by sunup.
This Mountain was hard-won.
I will not see it taken again.
The people of Lake-town have nothing.
They came to us in need.
They have lost everything.
Do not tell me what they have lost.
I know well enough their hardship.
Those who have lived through dragon fire...
...should rejoice.
They have much...
...to be grateful for.
More stone.
Bring more stone to the gate!
That's it.
- These children are starving.
- We need food.
- We won't last three days.
- Bard...
- ...we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.
It'll be all right. Don't worry.
We need more water.
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.
Here you are.
Good morning, Alfrid.
What news from the night watch?
All quiet, sire. Not much to report.
Nothing gets past me.
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...
- ...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.
Here you go.
Pass it back.
Another one.
You have saved us.
I do not know how to thank you.
Your gratitude is misplaced.
Page 14/39

I did not come on your behalf.
I came to reclaim something of mine.
There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.
White gems of pure starlight.
The White Gems of Lasgalen.
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.
Wait! Please wait!
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.
We are allies in this.
My people...
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.
Let me...
...speak with Thorin.
You would try to reason with the Dwarf?
To avoid war?
Yes.
Not a bad night's work.
Come on.
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.
Why do you come to the gates...
...of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...
...like a robber in his hold?
Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.
My lord...
...we have not come to rob you...
...but to seek fair settlement.
Will you not speak with me?
I am listening.
On behalf of the people of Lake-town...
...I ask that you honor your pledge.
A share of the treasure...
...so that they might rebuild their lives.
I will not treat with any man...
Page 15/39

...while an armed host lies before my door.
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.
And your threats do not sway me.
What of your conscience?
Does it not tell you our cause is just?
My people offered you help.
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?
A bargain was struck!
A bargain?
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright...
...for blankets and food?
To ransom...
...our future in exchange
for our freedom?
You call that a fair trade?
Tell me...
...Bard the Dragon-Slayer...
...why should I honor such terms?
Because you gave us your word.
Does that mean nothing?
Be gone!
Ere our arrows...
...fly!
What are you doing?
You cannot go to war.
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.
We are, in fact, outnumbered.
Not for much longer.
What does that mean?
It means, Master Baggins...
...you should never underestimate Dwarves.
We have reclaimed Erebor.
Now...
...we defend it.
Page 16/39

He will give us nothing.
Such a pity.
Still...
- ...you tried.
- I do not understand.
Why?
Why would he risk war?
It is fruitless to reason with them.
They understand...
...only one thing.
We attack at dawn.
Are you with us?
Aye.
Master Baggins, come here.
You're going to need this.
Put it on.
This vest is made of silver steel.
Mithril...
...it was called by my forebears.
No blade can pierce it.
I look absurd.
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.
It is a gift.
A token of our friendship.
True friends are hard to come by.
I have been blind...
...but now I begin to see.
I am betrayed.
Betrayed?
The Arkenstone.
One of them has taken it.
One of them is false.
Thorin...
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain.
Is that not enough?
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.
Now, is this treasure...
...truly worth more than your honor?
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.
Page 17/39

For that, I am grateful.
It was nobly done, but the treasure...
...does not belong to the people...
...of Lake-town.
This gold...
...is ours.
And ours alone.
By my life...
...I will not part...
...with a single coin.
Not...
...one...
...piece of it.
Gundabad.
What lies beyond?
An old enemy.
The ancient kingdom...
...of Angmar.
This fortress was once its stronghold.
It is where they kept their great armories.
Forged their weapons of war.
A light. I saw movement.
We wait for the cover of night.
It is a fell place, Tauriel.
In another age, our people waged war...
...on those lands.
My mother died there.
My father does not speak of it.
There is no grave.
No memory.
Nothing.
- Unh!
- Let me through!
Make way!
No, no.
No! Oi! You!
Pointy hat!
Yes.
You. We don't want no tramps, beggars...
...nor vagabonds here.
We got enough trouble
without the likes of you.
Off you go. On your horse.
Who's in charge here?
Page 18/39

Who is asking?
You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.
War is coming!
The cesspits...
...of Dol Guldur have been...
...emptied.
You're all...
...in mortal danger.
What are you talking about?
You know nothing...
...of Wizards.
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.
But sometimes a storm...
...is just a storm.
Not this time.
Armies of Orcs are on the move.
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.
Why show his hand now?
Because we forced him.
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
set out to reclaim...
...their homeland.
The Dwarves were never meant
to reach Erebor.
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them.
His master seeks control of the Mountain.
Not just for the treasure within...
...but for where it lies,
its strategic position.
This is the gateway...
...to reclaiming
the lands of Angmar in the North.
If that fell kingdom should rise again...
...Rivendell, Lrien, the Shire...
...even Gondor itself, will fall.
These Orc armies you speak of,
Mithrandir...
...where are they?
Page 19/39

These bats are bred for one purpose.
For what?
For war.
Come on, let's get those blades sharpened.
Aye. Blasted Elves.
- You swing an ax at it?
- No, brother.
You should be inside.
Out of the wind.
No, I...
...needed some air.
Place still stinks of dragon.
The Elves have been moving...
- ...their archers into position.
- Ah.
The battle will be over...
...by tomorrow's eve.
Though I doubt we will live
to see it.
No, these are dark days.
Dark days indeed.
Hmm.
No one could blame a soul
for wishing themselves elsewhere.
Must be nearing midnight.
Bombur's got the next watch.
It'll take a bit to wake him.
Bofur?
I will see you in the morning.
Goodbye, Bilbo.
Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?
What do you think I'm trying to do?
Save your Dwarvish friends,
and I admire...
...your loyalty to them.
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.
You started this, Mithrandir.
You will forgive me if I finish it.
Are the archers in position?
- Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.
If anything moves on that Mountain...
Page 20/39

...kill it.
The Dwarves are out of time.
Bowman!
Do you agree?
Is gold so important to you?
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?
It won't come to that.
- This is a fight they cannot win.
- That won't stop them.
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.
They will fight to the death.
Bilbo Baggins.
If I'm not mistaken...
...this is the Halfling
who stole the keys...
...to my dungeons from under...
...the nose of my guards.
Yes.
Sorry...
...about that.
I came...
...to give you...
...this.
The Heart of the Mountain.
The King's Jewel.
And worth a king's ransom.
How is this...
...yours to give?
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.
Why would you do this?
You owe us no loyalty.
I'm not doing it for you.
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate...
...and pigheaded...
...and difficult.
They're suspicious and secretive...
...with the worst manners...
...imaginable,
but they are also brave...
...and kind...
...and loyal to a fault.
Page 21/39

I've grown...
...very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.
Now, Thorin...
...values this stone above all else.
In exchange for its return,
he will give you...
...what you are owed.
There will be no need...
...for war.
Rest up tonight.
- You must leave on the morrow.
- What?
- Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not leaving the Company.
There is no Company. Not anymore.
Imagine what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.
I'm not afraid of Thorin.
Well, you should be.
Don't underestimate...
...the evil of gold.
Gold over which...
...a serpent has long brooded.
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all...
...who come near this Mountain.
Almost all. Heh.
You there.
Find this Hobbit a bed...
...and fill his belly with hot food.
He's earned it.
Hey.
Keep an eye on him.
If he should try...
...to leave, you tell me.
Move it!
Stupid Hobbit.
Wakey-wakey, Hobbit. Up you get.
I will put the next one between your eyes.
We have come to tell you...
...payment of your debt has been offered...
Page 22/39

...and accepted.
What payment?
I gave you nothing.
You have nothing.
We have this.
They have the Arkenstone.
Thieves!
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?
That stone belongs to the king!
And the king may have it...
...with our goodwill.
But first he must honor his word.
They are taking us for fools.
This is a ruse.
A filthy lie.
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!
It is a trick!
It's no trick.
The stone is real.
I gave it to them.
You?
I took it as my 14th share.
You would steal from me?
Steal from you? No.
No, I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.
I'll let it stand against my claim.
Against your claim?
Your claim.
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!
I was going to give it to you.
- Many times I wanted to, but...
- But what...
...thief?
You are changed, Thorin.
The Dwarf I met...
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word.
Would never have doubted...
...the loyalty of his kin!
Do not speak to me...
...of loyalty.
Page 23/39

Throw him from the rampart!
Did you not hear me?
I will do it myself. Curse you!
No!
Cursed be the Wizard...
- ...that forced you on us!
- If you don't like my burglar...
...then please...
...don't damage him.
Return him to me.
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain...
...are you, Thorin...
...son of Thrain?
Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!
Go.
Or Shire rats!
Are we resolved?
The return...
...of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?
Why should I...
...buy back that which is...
...rightfully mine?
Keep the stone...
...sell it.
Ecthelion of Gondor
will give you a good price for it.
I will kill you!
By my oath,
I will kill you all!
Your oath means nothing.
I've heard enough.
Thorin...
...lay down your arms.
Open these doors.
This treasure...
...will be your death.
Thorin, we cannot...
...win this fight.
Give us your answer.
Will you have peace...
...or war?
Page 24/39

I will have war.
Ironfoot.
Hey, Thorin!
Ironfoot has come!
Who is that?
He doesn't look very happy.
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills.
Thorin's...
- ...cousin.
- Are they alike?
I've always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.
Good morning.
How are we all?
I have a wee proposition...
...if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments...
...of your time.
Would you consider...
...just sodding off?
All of you!
Right now!
Stand fast.
Come now, Lord Dain.
Gandalf the Grey.
Tell this rabble...
...to leave, or I'll water...
...the ground with their blood!
No need for war...
...between Dwarves, Men and Elves.
A legion of Orcs...
...march on the Mountain.
Stand down.
I will not stand down before any Elf.
Not least this faithless Woodland sprite.
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people.
If he chooses...
...to stand between me and my kin...
...I'll split his pretty head open!
See if he's still smirking then.
Dain...
...wait!
Let them advance.
See how far they get.
Page 25/39

You think I give a dead dog
for your threats...
...you pointy-eared...
...princess?
You hear that, lads? We're on!
Let's give these bastards
a good hammering!
Stand your men down.
I'll deal with Ironfoot and his rabble.
Right then.
Let's get this done.
Send in the goats.
Thranduil!
This is madness!
How do you like that,
the old twirley-whirlies?
Ha, ha, you buggers!
Were-worms.
Oh, come on.
The hordes of hell are upon us!
Fight to the death!
I'm going over the wall.
Who's coming with me?
- Aye!
- Come on, let's go!
- Stand down.
- What?
Are we to do nothing?
I said, stand down!
The Elves.
Will they not fight?
Charge!
Yes!
Uh, Gandalf?
Is this a good place to stand?
Azog.
He's trying to cut us off.
All of you!
Fall back to Dale!
Now!
To the city!
Bilbo! This way!
Sigrid!
Tilda!
Page 26/39

My children! Where are my children?
I saw them!
They were down in the old market!
The market?
Where are they now?
Tilda! Sigrid!
Bard! Orcs are storming over the causeway!
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them off as long as you can.
Archers! This way!
The Orcs have taken Stone Street!
The market's overrun!
The rest of you...
...follow me!
Charge! Onward!
To the death!
Da!
Da!
- Here!
- We're down here!
Bain!
Sigrid! Get down!
Listen!
Gather...
...the women and children.
Take them to the Great Hall...
...and barricade the door.
You understand?
You must not come out for any reason.
We want to stay with you!
Show your father some respect.
You leave it to me...
...sire.
You heard him.
- We make for the Great Hall.
- Alfrid!
Women and children only.
I need every man...
...fighting.
See that you return.
I'll get them to safety, sire.
Then my sword is yours to command.
Get up!
Look after them.
Page 27/39

Shift it, granny!
Make for the Great Hall!
Out of my way!
Abandon the cripples!
You buggers!
Where's Thorin?
We need him! Where is he?
Fall back!
Since when do we forsake...
...our own people?
Thorin...
...they are dying...
...out there.
There are halls beneath halls
within this Mountain.
Places we can fortify...
...shore up, make safe.
Yes.
Yes...
...that is it.
We must move the gold
further underground...
- ...to safety.
- Did you hear me?
Dain is surrounded.
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.
Many die in war.
Life is cheap.
But a treasure...
...such as this cannot be counted...
...in lives lost.
It is worth...
...all the blood we can spend.
You sit here in these vast halls...
...with a crown upon your head...
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.
Do not speak to me...
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...
...as if...
...I were still...
...Thorin...
...Oakenshield.
- I am your king!
Page 28/39

- You were always my king.
You used to know that once.
You cannot see what you have become.
Go.
Get out.
Before I kill you.
You sit here...
...with a crown upon your head.
You are lesser now
than you have ever been.
But a treasure such as this
cannot be counted in lives lost.
A sickness lies upon that treasure.
The blind ambition of a Mountain King.
Am I not the king?
This gold...
...is ours.
And ours alone.
I will not part...
...with a single coin.
He could not see
beyond his own desire!
As if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...
...Thorin Oakenshield.
A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.
This is Thorin...
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!
I am not my grandfather.
I am not my grandfather.
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin.
They are dying out there.
Take back Erebor.
Dain is surrounded.
Dying.
Is surrounded.
Dying.
Take back your homeland.
You are changed, Thorin.
I am not my grandfather.
Is this treasure truly worth more
than your honor?
I am not my grandfather.
This treasure will be your death!
Page 29/39

Fall back!
Fall back...
...to the Mountain!
Fall back!
I will not hide...
...behind a wall of stone...
...while others fight our battles for us!
It is not in my blood, Thorin.
No.
It is not.
We are sons of Durin.
And Durin's Folk...
...do not flee from a fight.
I have no right to ask this of any of you.
But will you follow me...
...one last time?
Thorin.
To the king!
To the king!
The Dwarves.
They're rallying.
They're rallying to their king.
Any man who wants to give their last...
...follow me!
Come on, Bombur. Get up.
- Nori.
- Gloin!
Right behind you, brother.
I say we stand with our men
in life and in death.
- I'm with you.
- Arm yourselves.
- Come with us.
- No, no, no.
- You leave an old woman be.
- Don't be afraid.
I said, get off!
Alfrid Lickspittle.
You are a coward.
"Coward"?
Not every man's brave enough
to wear a corset.
You're not a man.
You're a weasel.
Page 30/39

Dain!
Thorin!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Hey, cousin!
What took you so long?
There's too many of these buggers, Thorin.
I hope you've got a plan.
Aye.
We're going to take out their leader.
Azog?
I'm gonna kill that piece of filth.
Thorin, you cannot do this.
You're our king.
That is why I must do it.
And how do you plan to fight your way
single-handed to Ravenhill?
Halt!
It's been a while since I've done this.
To Ravenhill!
Hold tight, lads.
You're all mad bastards.
I like it.
May Durin save you all.
Watch out!
Eyes front...
...lads!
Hold on!
I'm out!
Bring it down!
- Shoot it!
- Where?
In his jambags!
It doesn't have any jambags!
- Duck!
- Kili!
Move it!
Hang on, lads! I'm coming!
Bofur, you beauty!
- Dwalin!
- Go!
Come on...
...you hairy hedgepig!
Come on!
Page 31/39

Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Wargs!
Hold tight, lads.
There's more coming!
We're pulling too much weight.
We won't make it.
Cut the tracers.
Ride them to Ravenhill.
No, Balin.
My goat-riding days are over.
Durin be with you, brother.
I am too old for this.
Hyah!
Onwards!
Lead on!
Get up.
Get away from me.
I don't take orders...
...from you.
People trusted you.
They listened to you.
The Master's mantle...
...was there for the taking...
...and you threw it all away.
For what?
Alfrid...
...your slip is showing.
We may yet survive this.
Gandalf!
It's Thorin.
And Fili, Kili...
...and Dwalin.
He's taking his best warriors.
To do what?
To cut the head off the snake.
Die!
Gandalf!
Legolas.
Legolas Greenleaf.
There is a second army.
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.
Page 32/39

Gundabad.
This was their plan all along.
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.
The North?
Where is the North...
- ...exactly?
- Ravenhill.
Ravenhill?
Thorin is up there.
And Fili and Kili. They're all up there.
Where is he?
It looks empty.
I think Azog has fled.
I don't think so.
Fili...
...take your brother.
Scout out the towers.
Keep low and out of sight.
If you see something...
...report back. Do not engage.
- Do you understand?
- We have company.
Goblin mercenaries.
No more than a hundred.
We'll take care of them. Go!
Go!
Come on!
Recall your company.
My lord, dispatch this force...
...to Ravenhill.
The Dwarves are about...
...to be overrun.
Thorin must be warned.
By all means, warn him.
I have spent enough Elvish blood
in defense...
...of this accursed land. No more.
Thranduil?
I'll go.
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll never make it.
Why not?
Because they will see you coming
Page 33/39

and kill you.
No, they won't.
They won't see me.
It's out of the question.
I won't allow it.
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.
You will not turn away.
Not this time.
Get out of my way.
The Dwarves will be slaughtered.
Yes, they will die.
Today...
...tomorrow...
...one year hence,
a hundred years from now.
What does it matter?
They are mortal.
You think your life is worth more...
...when there is no love in it?
There is no love in you.
What do you know of love?
Nothing.
What you feel for that Dwarf...
...is not real.
You think it is love?
Are you ready to die for it?
I will go with you.
Push!
By Durin, you've lost your ax.
No, he's not.
There you go, cousin.
You know where you can stick that.
Hey. Stay here.
Search the lower levels.
I've got this.
Where is that Orc filth?
Thorin.
Bilbo.
You have to leave here. Now.
Azog has an army attacking
from the North.
This watchtower will be surrounded.
- With no way out.
- We are so close.
Page 34/39

That Orc scum is in there.
I say we push on.
No. That's what he wants.
He wants to draw us in.
This is a trap.
Ah.
Find Fili and Kili. Call them back.
Thorin, are you sure about this?
Do it.
We'll live to fight another day.
Oh...
Go.
Run!
Kili!
Thorin.
Thorin. No.
No.
Kili.
Kili!
Kili!
Tauriel!
Kili.
No!
No!
Mm.
Tauriel!
The Eagles are coming.
Bilbo.
Don't move. Don't move. Lie still.
Oh. Mm. Mm.
I'm glad you are here.
- Shh, shh.
- Unh.
I wish to part from you in friendship.
No.
You are not going anywhere.
You're going to live.
I would take back...
...my words and my deeds at the Gate.
You did what only a true friend would do.
Forgive me.
I was too blind to see it.
I am so sorry...
...that I have led you into such peril.
Page 35/39

No, I'm glad to have shared
in your perils, Thorin.
Each and every one of them.
It is far more than any Baggins deserves.
Farewell...
...Master Burglar.
Go back to your books.
And your armchair.
Plant your trees.
Watch them grow.
If more people...
...valued home...
...above gold...
...this world would be a merrier place.
No. No, no, no. No.
Thorin. Thorin, don't you dare.
Thorin.
Thorin. Thorin, hold on.
Hold on, please.
The Eagles...
The Eagles... The Eagles are here.
Thorin?
The Ea...
I cannot go back.
Where will you go?
I do not know.
Go north.
Find the Dnedain.
There's a young Ranger amongst them.
You should meet him.
His father, Arathorn, was a good man.
His son...
...might grow to be a great one.
What is his name?
He's known in the Wild as Strider.
His true name...
...you must discover for yourself.
Legolas.
Your mother loved you.
More than anyone.
More than life.
They want to bury him.
Yes.
If this is love, I do not want it.
Page 36/39

Take it from me.
Please.
Why does it hurt so much?
Because it was real.
The king is dead.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
There is to be a great feast tonight.
Songs will be sung. Tales will be told.
And Thorin Oakenshield...
...will pass into legend.
I know that's how you must honor him.
But to me, he was never that.
He was...
To me...
...he was...
I'll slip quietly away.
Will you tell the others I said goodbye?
You can tell them yourself.
If any of you are ever
passing Bag End, uh...
...tea is at 4.
There's plenty of it.
You are welcome anytime.
Uh...
Don't bother knocking.
Ah, the borders of the Shire.
It is here I must leave you.
That's a shame.
I quite liked having...
...a Wizard around.
Seems they bring good luck.
You don't really suppose, do you,
that all your adventures and escapes...
...were managed by mere luck?
Magic rings should not be used lightly,
Bilbo.
Don't take me for a fool.
I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels.
And I've kept my eye on you...
...ever since.
Well, thank goodness.
Farewell, Gandalf.
Farewell.
Page 37/39

You, uh...
You needn't worry about that ring.
Fell out of my pocket during the battle.
I lost it.
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins.
And I'm very fond...
...of you.
But you're only quite a little fellow...
...in a wide world after all.
Wait a minute,
that's my mother's glory box.
And that's my dining chair.
Ah... Put that pouf down!
What is going on?
Hello...
...Mr. Bilbo.
You're not supposed to be here.
What do you mean?
On account of you
being presumed dead.
I am not dead.
Presumed or otherwise.
I'm not sure that's permitted.
Mr. Bilbo!
Twenty-one! Any advance on 21?
Any advance on 21?
Ha, ha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger.
Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on.
Any bids for this?
This is Shire-made.
No Dwarvish reproductions here.
Stop!
Stop!
- There's been a mistake!
- Who are you?
Who am I?
You know who I am...
...Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.
This is my home.
And those are my spoons.
Thank you very much.
- This is most irregular.
- Excuse me.
It's been more...
Page 38/39

...than 13 months since the disappearance.
If you are in fact...
...Bilbo Baggins and undeceased...
...can you prove it?
What?
Something official with your name...
...on it would suffice.
All right. Right.
A contract of employment as a bur...
Never mind as what.
There. My signature.
Yes, well... Uh...
Well, it certainly seems to be in order.
Yes.
Seems there can be no doubt.
Who is this you pledged
your service to?
Thorin Oakenshield?
He...
He was my friend.
No, thank you!
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers...
...or distant relations!
And what about...
...very old friends?
Gandalf?
Bilbo Baggins.
My dear Gandalf! Ha, ha!
It's good to see you.
One hundred and 11 years old.
Who would believe it?
Come on, come in!
Welcome. Welcome.
