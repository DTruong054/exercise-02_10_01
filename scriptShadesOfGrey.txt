Ana, take my car.
I gave you the recorder right?
- Oh, yes.
- And you have all the questions?
- Yes.
- And you know where you're going?
Yes, I do have a GPS, and a four point GPA.
- I can figure it out.
- You're wearing that?
Okay, a little less talking, more eating.
Miss Kavanagh?
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, yes.
Ella... Ella... Okay.
- Mr Grey will see you now.
- Okay.
- This way please.
- Okay.
Mr Grey is in a conference at 11:15.
Right this way.
Miss Kavanagh, are you alright?
- Christian Grey.
- I'm Anastasia Steele.
Miss Kavanagh has the flu,
so she asked me to fill in.
I see, so you're studying
journalism as well?
No. English literature Kate's my roommate.
As I said, I only have 10 minutes.
Please, have a seat Miss Steele.
Thanks.
- Ready?
- Whenever you are.
Okay.
So this is for the special graduation issue
of the student newspaper.
Yes I'm giving the commencement address
at this year's ceremony.
You are?
I mean um I know.
You are very young to
have amassed an empire.
- To what do you owe...
- To what do I owe my success?
- Yep.
- Seriously?
Yes.
Business is about people, and
I've always been good at people.
What motivates them, what inspires them.
Well maybe you're just lucky
I've always seen, the more hard eye
work, the more luck I seem to have.
The key to my success is
identifying talents in individuals.
- And harnessing their efforts.
- You're a control freak?
Oh I exercise control in
all things Miss Steele.
Okay um, your company is involved primarily
in the telecommunications sector.
Yet you also invest in numerous
agricultural projects.
Including several in Africa. Is that
something you feel passionate about?
Feeding the world's poor?
Its smart business.
You don't agree?
I don't know enough about it.
I just wonder, if you're heart might be
a bit bigger than you want to let on?
But some people say I don't have a heart.
- Why would they say that?
- Because they know me well.
Continue.
Do you have any interests outside of work?
I enjoy various physical pursuits.
You're unmarried, oh you
were adopted at age four.
That's a matter of public record.
I'm sorry I didn't...
Do you have an actual
question, Miss Steele?
Yes.
Are you gay?
Its written here, I'm just...
No, Anastasia. I'm not gay.
I apologise, Mr Grey
Kate can be a little...
- Intrusive?
- Curious.
What about you?
Why don't you ask me
something you wanna know?
Earlier you said that there are some
people who know you well.
Why do I have the feeling
that that is not true?
Mr Grey, your next meeting
is in the conference room.
Cancel it please, we're not finished here.
Yes sir.
No I um I can go.
- Its fine.
- I would like to know more about you.
There's not really much to know about me.
You said you're in English literature? Tell
me was it Charlotte Bront, Jane Austen
or Thomas Hardy, who made you fall in love
with literature?
Hardy.
I would've guessed Jane Austen.
What are your plans for after you graduate?
I'm just trying to get through my finals.
- And then?
- Then I was planning on moving here
to Seattle with Kate.
We offer an excellent internship program
I don't think I'd fit in here.
- Look at me.
- I am.
Mr Grey's office
I hope you got everything you needed
I think you only answered four questions.
- Anastasia.
- Christian.
Holy cow.
- Before you say anything...
- You're a goddess, this is perfect.
What?
I just got his email, he
answered every question.
So? What was he like?
- He was fine.
- Fine? Just fine?
He was very polite, and
courteous, very formal and clean.
Clean?
I mean, he was you know, smart.
And intense, kind of intimidating.
- I can understand the fascination.
- Uh huh!
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?
Okay.
I'm gonna make a sandwich, you want one?
No, thanks.
You have to admit, he's ridiculously hot.
I'm sure if you're attracted
to that sort of human.
The hot type of human?
I asked him if he was gay.
It was in your questions.
Why would you do that to me?
Because whenever he's in the society pages.
He's never been photographed
with a woman So naturally.
Well maybe he just wants to keep
his private life private Kate.
- And now you're defending him.
- I'm ending this conversation.
Too bad we don't have any
original photos of your
hot, clean, 27 year old billionaire.
The camera loves him as much as you do.
Okay I wasn't hungry, but now I am.
Thank you.
- Ana, I've been looking for you.
- Whats up?
- Guess what?
- What?
Portland's place is going to exhibit
my photographs next month.
Oh my god!
Congratulations, that's so good!
- It feels so good.
- Can we celebrate later?
- Cause I'm really late for work.
- Yeah, yeah, you got it, you got it.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Thank you, you're my hero.
- See you later.
- Okay.
Mom I'm at work can I call you back?
No wait I called for a reason.
Bob broke his foot playing
golf of all things.
Christ is he okay?
In a lot of pain?
Who knows? The man called the paramedics
because of a blister.
It means though, we won't
be able to fly in for graduation.
Really? You could just come alone,
you don't have to bring Bob.
Least I could do to fend for himself.
- You understand don't you darling?
- Yeah, yeah its fine.
- I really have to go, okay?
- I love you Ana.
I know I love you too.
God.
- Ana... can you give me a hand out back?
- Uh yeah yeah, I'll be right there.
- Thought it was you.
- What the fuck?
What a pleasant surprise Miss Steele.
It's Ana, just Ana.
You're in here...
I was in the area on business,
needed to pick up a few things.
- Are you free?
- Yeah What can I help you with?
Do you stock cable ties?
Cable ties, yes we do, I
can show you if you want.
- Please, lead the way Miss Steele.
- Its Ana.
- That it?
- Masking tape.
- Are you redecorating?
- No.
We have one inch and two
inch, but the truly self
respecting handyman would
have both in his tool box.
Of course he will.
It's rare to find a
connoisseur these days...
- Did you want anything else?
- Yes, rope.
That's very impressive.
Do you girl scouts?
No, organized activity groups
aren't really my thing.
- So what is your thing?
- I don't know Books?
Okay, rope, tape, cable ties
You're like a complete serial killer.
- Not today.
- Anything else?
- What would you recommend?
- For a do-it-yourself er?
Maybe coveralls, to
protect all your clothes?
- Or I could just take all my clothes off.
- Okay, no clothes
I mean, no coveralls I can't
think of anything else.
- I guess that must be it.
- Cool.
Thank you for answering
Kate's questions by the way.
- She was thrilled.
- I hope she's feeling better.
Yeah she is, she's just having trouble
finding an original photo of you.
If she'd like an original,
I'm around tomorrow.
- You'd be willing to do that?
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to bag for you Ana?
- No, I'm good, thanks though Paul.
Okay.
I'm staying at the Heathman.
Call me before 10.
- About the photos.
- Oh, yeah, I will.
Enjoy your...
Thanks for doing this again Mr Grey.
- I'm happy to help.
- How about we try a few with a smile?
Or not.
You do realise he hasn't
stopped looking at you?
He asked me to go for coffee afterwards.
What?
Kate shh
Is he your boyfriend?
- Who?
- The photographer.
- Jose? No.
- I've seen the way he was smiling at you.
No Jose is more like family.
He's not my boyfriend.
- And the guy at the store?
- Paul? No.
Thank you.
- You seem nervous.
- I find you intimidating.
You should.
- Eat.
- Not to mention high-handed.
I'm used to getting my own way.
Then you must get very boring.
- Tell me about your family.
- My family? Okay.
My dad died when I was a baby.
So I was raised by my step-father Ray.
- He's amazing.
- And your mom?
My mother is on husband number four.
She's an incurable romantic.
- And you?
- Am I romantic?
Well I study English Literature.
I kind of have to be.
But the photo shoot went well right?
Kate seems to be really happy.
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- What?
I'll walk you out.
- Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?
- I don't do the girlfriend thing.
- What does that even mean?
- Watch it!
I'm not the man for you.
You should steer clear of me.
I have to let you go.
Goodbye Mr Grey.
Alright pencils down.
Please take your final exams
to the back of the classroom.
Final grades will be posted in two weeks.
- Hey, you all good?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?
- We are so partying tonight.
- Oh my god.
This is way too much.
No, we're getting exactly the right amount.
- All over my face?
- That's the idea.
- Wow, no Kate.
- Cab's early, lets go.
Ana, there's a package for you.
"Why didn't you tell me there was danger?
Why didn't you warn me?
"Ladies know what to guard against
"... because they read novels
that tells them of these tricks ".
That's a quote from Tess
of the d'Urberville.
Oh my god.
These must be from Christian.
I mean
These are incredible.
Wow, Grey.
Kate these are first editions
I can't, this is too much.
I can't accept them, I
have to send them back.
That's the cab, okay, are you ready?
- Are you really though?
- Yes, yes, very.
Lets get outta here.
Shots! Shots! Shots!
No holding back here girl.
- Did you do it all?
- Alright!
With my right eye closed and left handed,
I can get this in.
- What?
- I gotta pee.
- Okay.
- One, two...
- Where you going?
- I gotta go pee.
- Anastasia.
- Yep, this is me.
Sending back your expensive books, cause
I already have hard copies of that,
Thanks though, for the kind gesture.
You're welcome. Where are you?
Oh I'm in line, cause I
have to pee really bad.
- Anastasia have you been drinking?
- Yeah, I have Mr Fancy Pants.
You hit the nail on the head.
I mean the head right on the nail.
Listen to me, I want you
to go home right now.
You're so bossy.
"Ana, lets go for coffee"
"Ana, lets go for coffee."
"No stay away from me Ana, I
don't want you. Get away."
"Come here, come here."
"Go away."
That's it.
- Tell me where you are.
- I'm a long way from Seattle.
- Long way from you.
- Which bar, whats it called?
- I don't know, I gotta go.
- Which bar Ana?
I told him right?
I'm sorry I didn't mean...
Stay where you are, I'm coming to get you.
What? Hello?
- Hey.
- Oh thanks.
Are you okay?
Yes, I just feel a little
more drunk than...
- Come here stay warm.
- Oh that's cool, I'm good Jose.
No, I wanna have the courage to do this.
Do what?
- Ana, I like you.
- You do?
- Very much.
- Oh my god.
- No, no, no.
- Please, one kiss.
No, no, no Jos, I'm sorry, no.
- Dude, she said no.
- Christian?
- Don't look at me.
- Here.
Nice touch, I will launder this item.
- Lets get you home.
- I'm with kate.
- I'll have Elliot tell her.
- Who's Elliot?
He's my brother, he's inside
talking to her right now.
- I, I don't...
- He's at my hotel with me.
- You're still at the Heathman?
- Yes. Come.
- That's your brother?
- Not by choice, lets go.
Wait what did Kate say?
She warned me to be on my best behaviour.
- More like threatened me.
- She threatened you?
You're spinning.
I think I'm gonna faint.
What now?
Eat me, drink me.
Good morning Anastasia.
- How you feeling?
- Better than I deserve.
Did you put me to bed?
- You undressed me?
- I didn't have much choice.
Where did you sleep?
- Dear god We didn't...
- Necrophillia's not my thing.
- So we just slept then?
- It was a novelty for me too.
You... need to eat.
I had Taylor pick you up some clothes.
- Who's Taylor?
- My driver.
- Thanks, but you didn't have to do that.
- Yes I did.
Yours were covered in vomit.
You shouldn't have drunk like that.
I'm all for testing the limits but
- ...you put yourself at risk last night.
- I know.
If you were mine you wouldn't
be able to sit down for a week.
What?
I gotta go take a shower.
Why am I here Christian?
You're here because I'm
incapable of leaving you alone.
Then don't.
- Why'd you send me those books?
- I thought I owed you an apology.
- For what?
- For letting you believe that I...
Listen to me.
I don't do romance.
My tastes are very... singular.
You wouldn't understand.
Enlighten me then.
- You look beautiful.
- Taylor has good taste.
- What are you doing here later?
- I'm working at the hardware store till 7.
I'll have Taylor pick you up then.
I'd like to bite that lip.
I think I'd like that.
I'm not gonna touch you, not
until I have your written consent.
What?
I'll explain later.
Come I'll take you home.
Fuck the paperwork.
What is it about elevators?
Hey.
- Hi, you must be Ana.
- You must be Elliot.
And we must be going, Elliot.
So awesome your place.
Kate's told me a lot about you.
Elliot grab your shoes, some
of us have work to return to.
What you're doing with Mr. Worm
here, I've got no idea.
Laters baby.
I'll see you tonight, email
me if something changes.
My computer's broken.
Well call then, you know
you have my number.
Laters baby.
- Elliot seems really nice.
- No, no. We're starting with you.
If you're seeing him again tonight,
this means that something happened.
- Ana? Tell me what happened...
- I have to get ready for work.
We just kissed. Once.
Only once? That's odd.
- Odd doesn't even cover it.
- Uh huh, and a new jacket.
Bye.
Hi, its Taylor right?
Good evening Miss Steele, Mr
Grey will be joining us there.
Good evening, Anastasia.
What, you're flying this?
No escaping now.
November 1-2-2-4. Charlie Tango.
Ready to depart.
Charlie tango, your flight plan to
Seattle has been cleared..
Seattle?
That's where we're going?
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes please.
- You play?
- Yes.
Of course you do.
- Whats this?
- Its a nondisclosure agreement.
It means you cannot discuss
anything about us with anyone.
I'm afraid my lawyer insists on it.
I would never talk to
anyone about us anyway.
Are you gonna make love to me now?
Two things: First, I don't make love
I fuck... hard.
- And the second?
- Come.
- Its just around this door.
- What is it?
- My playroom.
- Like your xbox and stuff?
Its important you know that
you can leave at any time.
Why, whats in there?
I meant what I said, the helicopter
is not standby, for whenever you wanna go.
Just open the door.
Oh my god.
Its called a flogger.
Say something please.
Do women do this to you or...
I do this to women. With women.
Women who want me to.
- You're a sadist?
- I'm a dominant.
What does that mean?
It means I want you to willingly
surrender yourself to me.
Why would I do that?
- To please me.
- Please you? How?
I have rules, if you follow
them, I'll reward you.
If you don't, I'll punish you.
You'd punish me, you'd
use this stuff on me?
- Yes.
- What would I get out of this?
Me.
If we were to do this,
this would be your room.
You can decorate it however you like.
You want me to move in?
Not full time, just
Friday through to Sunday.
- We can negotiate the particulars.
- So... I'd sleep in here with you?
No I sleep downstairs.
I told you I don't sleep with anyone.
What if I don't want
anything to do with that?
Then I understand completely.
But then we wouldn't have any
sort of relationship at all?
This is the only sort
of relationship I have.
- Why?
- Its the way I am.
When you said negotiate, what did you mean?
I already have the contract prepared.
Fairly detailed.
You would review, and negotiate what
you are and not willing to try.
How can I know what I'd be willing to try?
Well when you had sex, was there
anything you didn't like doing?
We have to be honest with
each other for this to work,
Okay?
- I I wouldn't know.
- What do you mean?
- Because I haven't...
- You're still a virgin?
- I've just shown you...
- I know, I know.
- You've done other things right?
- No.
- Where have you been?
- Waiting.
Guys must throw themselves at you.
They're never what I've wanted.
Your biting your lip.
- What are you doing?
- Rectifying the situation.
I'm a situation?
You're energetic this morning.
- You hungry?
- Very.
Because I'm making pancakes.
Lets get you cleaned up.
Do you trust me?
Stay here.
Hold out your wrists.
Hold them there. Understand?
- Tell me you understand.
- I won't move my arms.
Good girl.
- Stay still.
- Okay.
- Say yes.
- To what.
Being mine.
Christian!
- Shit.
- Its my mother.
- I'm naked.
- Get dressed.
No need to show me around,
no need to hover.
- He's sleeping Dr. Grey.
- Still sleeping? He never sleeps in.
Certainly not at this hour.
Unless of course he's ill is he?
Ah.
- Sorry Mr. Grey.
- Its fine I know how she can be.
She? Darling you can try to avoid me, but
the least you can do is.
Call me by my correct name, which is mama.
- Hi.
- Oh, dear god.
Mother, Anastasia Steele.
Ana, meet my mother.
Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey.
You have no idea how
delighted I am to meet you.
Its nice to meet you too Dr. Grey.
Grace. She's very pretty.
You are very pretty.
Thanks.
What happened to calling
before dropping by?
And have your head-henchman give
me the run around here, no thank you.
I'll take my chances. Well I was in the
neighbourhood and I thought perhaps
we could have lunch.
I can't today, I have to drive Ana home.
Its okay, take it.
I was just showing mother out.
Excuse me.
Anastasia!
- Kate, wait.
- It was a joy to meet you.
I'm having the whole family
for dinner at my house.
Christian's sister Mia is back
from Paris, so lets come.
We'll see mother.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
Kate.
Thank you.
I can't talk about it right now Kate.
I gotta go, I'll call you back okay?
Everything okay with the phone call?
Yeah, nothing important.
I liked your mom.
She's excited.
She's never seen me with a woman before.
You're the first.
What is it Ana?
I just How many women have stayed in here?
- That's a lot of women.
- I told you before, if you want out...
I don't want out, I'm just not
jumping at the opportunity
for whips, torture and
your red room of pain.
The red room is much more about pleasure.
I promise you.
Will we still go out to
dinner, and movies...
That's not really my thing.
Try to keep an open mind.
If you agree to be my submissive,
I will be devoted to you.
This is what I want.
And I want it with you.
Why do I have to sleep in here?
We slept in the same bed last night.
Like normal people.
Try not to get hung up on
the sleeping arrangements.
If you agree to do this, you're
gonna want your own room.
Why, because I'll be your sex slave?
I don't wanna do this here,
lets talk downstairs.
No. I think I'll hold on to my
freewill a little while longer thank you.
Actually you know what, I would like
to go home, can I go home?
- Which one's yours?
- All of them.
Lets go for a walk.
- How did you start doing this?
- One of my mother's friends.
- I was 15.
- She seduced you?
- I was her submissive for six years.
- Seriously, does your mother know that?
Of course not.
No one in my family knows about this.
Part of me.
So she introduced you to all of this?
Mrs Robinson?
Mrs Robinson? I'll tell her you said that.
She'll love it.
- You still talk to her?
- On occasions. We're friends.
Ana. I know how intimidating this is.
I felt the same at first.
Well What made you change your mind?
By giving up control, I felt
free, from responsibilities.
From making decisions.
I felt safe.
You will too, you'll see.
I never took anyone in the helicopter.
Never had sex in my own bed.
Never slept with anyone.
Ever. Only you.
This is the contract.
Read it carefully.
Email me if you have any questions.
I told you, my computer's down.
Just consider it okay?
I really hope you say yes.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Laters baby.
- Um.
- Okay, you're all set.
Your roommate let me in.
I just figured you forgot
to tell me about it.
- Do I look okay?
- Tell you about what?
- Just sign here.
- Hold on, do you have the right apartment?
Anastasia Steele?
- Enjoy.
- Another gift huh?
What happened to flowers and chocolate?
I'm dying to hear everything, but
I have to run right now, cause Elliot
and I are having dinner.
And then we're seeing a show at the Gorge.
Jose called for you, twice, by the way.
- Is that some article?
- No... These are.
These are my thesis notes,
I left them at school.
Oh okay, well there's yesterday's mail.
- What?
- I don't know. You look... different.
- I feel different.
- Of course you do.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Bye.

Don't make a sound.
That was really nice.
What are you doing to me?
What about here?
Why not?
Is that breaking the rules?
- Speaking of which...
- I haven't made up my mind yet.
You're not staying?
I told you.
I don't sleep with anyone.
Can we negotiate?
That's a hell of a sack Miss Steele.
Business meeting.
- Impressive.
- I've done this before.
- Business meetings I mean.
- Oh.
Miss Steele. Your meeting.
Page 1... strike out my old address
and replace it with the new one.
An oversight. Do go on.
Page 3, section 15-20.
"The submissive shall submit
to any sexual activity"
"... demanded by the dominant without
hesitation or argument."
Turn to page 5, appendix 3, soft limits.
- With you.
- Find anal fisting.
- I'm all ears.
- Strike it out.
Strike out vaginal fisting too.
- You sure?
- Yep.
Same page.
"Is the use of sex toys
acceptable to the submissive."
Vibrators... okay Dildos... fine.
Genital clamps... absolutely not.
- Consider them gone.
- What are butt plugs?
You must go through quite a few
non-disclosure agreements.
My staff know only what
I choose to tell them.
Please resume Miss Steele.
Also, on page 5, there are some terms
which need clarification.
- Suspension.
- Hanging on a rope from the ceiling.
- For what possible reason?
- For your pleasure.
- Really?
- And mine... something to consider.
No. Hard limit.
"Is bondage acceptable to the submissive?"
I'm good with rope.
Leather casts, hand cuffs...
Please lose tape.
- And whats others?
- Cable ties?
Can I just say how impressed I am
with your commitment to this meeting?
And in that spirit, I'm gonna
offer something sweeter.
How about, once a week, on a night
of your choosing, we go on a date.
Just like a regular couple:
Dinner, movie, ice skating.
- Whatever you want.
- Accepted.
- You're very kind.
- I'll suggest it in Appendix 5.
I would like to fuck you into
the middle of next week.
- You're not fighting fair.
- I never have.
I'll review all these changes and
try to arrive at a decision.
- You wanna leave?
- Yes.
But your body tells me something different.
Your legs for instance.
The way you're pressing your thighs
together under the table.
The change in your breathing.
And then your complexion.
- My complexion?
- You're flushed.
- That could just be the wine.
- Its the adrenaline.
Say I did stay.
What would happen?
First, I would help you out of
that little dress of yours.
- Yes?
- Then I'd be pleased to discover
- ...that you are naked underneath.
- Really?
- Then I would bend you over.
- Right here?
- Yes.
- On this table?
Yes.
Thank you for the meeting Mr. Grey.
This is me.
Didn't know I was a collector
of classic cars huh?
You're sure I can't persuade you to stay?
Goodnight, Christian.
- When will you know?
- Soon, maybe.
Why do I think you're telling me goodbye?
Because I'm leaving.
You got your speech ready yet?
More or less.
- Annie.
- Dad!
Hi.
Sorry I'm late, I had a
hell of a time parking.
Oh that's okay, you're here,
that's all that matters.
You're kidding me, I wouldn't
miss this for the world.
I saved you a seat next
to Kate's parents okay?
- I'll sit where you want Miss Steele.
- Okay. I'll see you after.
Yeah, good luck out there.
And is also a major benefactor
for our university.
Please join me in welcoming,
Mr Christian Grey.
Thank you. I am deeply moved by the great
compliment accorded to me today.
- He is so hot.
- Oh god. He so is.
I heard he's gay.
Sustainable methods of farming
for third world countries.
The goal? To eradicate hunger
and poverty across the globe.
I myself have known what its
like to be profoundly hungry.
So this is a very personal mission for me.
Anastasia Steele.
Thanks.
Congratulations, you must be very proud.
- I am. Nice tie by the way?
- Truthfully its become my favourite.
- Do you have your answer yet?
- I'm still thinking.
Anastasia, just try it my way.
Please.
- Okay.
- What?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Dad hi!
- I am so proud of you Annie.
Thank you.
Oh, Kate.
Best speech of all others.
- Thanks.
- Of course.
Yeah, I agree.
- Ana? Hi.
- Hi.
Ray, have you met Christian Grey?
Ana's new boyfriend?
Hi.
Great pleasure to meet you.
My pleasure.
I really enjoyed your speech.
Thank you sir.
Sounds like you've accomplished
some pretty impressive things.
And what things?
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'm gonna go find my family, who are
impatiently waiting to embarrass me.
Bye.
- Visit us soon yeah?
- Soon as I get an invitation.
So, how long you two known each other?
A few weeks now, we
actually met when Anastasia
interviewed me for the student newspaper.
- A picture please Mr. Grey?
- One minute excuse me.
Big smile now.
To celebrate your graduation.
Among other things.
Roll your eyes at me again and
I will take you across my knee.
So it begins.
- Come on, I've got something to show you.
- What?
That's cute.
Doesn't really seem like your style though.
Its not, happy graduation Anastasia.
Oh my god.
Christian that's a car.
You don't miss much do you?
Thank you but I can't.
This is too...
- Do you like it?
- Of course I like it, its beautiful.
But I have a car...
Where's my car?
I told Taylor to fetch
a decent price for it.
Christian, this is way too much.
Did you just roll your eyes at me?
- Do you know why I'm doing this?
- Because I rolled my eyes at you.
And is that polite?
No.
- Excuse me?
- No, sir.
- Do you want more?
- Yes. Yes.
Welcome to my world.
- What are you doing?
- There a few things at the office
which require my attention.
You okay?
- I just thought that...
- I enjoyed tonight.
I'll see you at my place tomorrow.
Hi mama.
Anastasia?, whats going on,
I've left you two messages this week.
I know I'm sorry.
I just got a little distracted.
I'm sorry I missed your graduation honey
I heard it was lovely.
And your new beau.
Ray told me all about him,
he sounds such a young man.
Of course, I would've preferred to
have heard about it from you.
Ana?
Whats the matter?
Nothing I'm fine.
Is he not making you happy?
He is yeah, I mean most of the time yeah.
Its complicated.
Listen honey, if you need a break, you just
come on right down here.
Even if its just for a day or two.
I have air miles, and we could
talk and have girl time.
- Promise me you'll think about it?
- Yeah I promise. I promise.
- I love you mama.
- I love you too darling.
I gotta go. Bye.
Looks like you and Grey did
some celebration last night.
- Is he still asleep?
- No, he couldn't stay.
Well whose car keys are those then?
- Those are my keys.
- Wow Ana.
What?
Nothing, I'm just...
Make sure you're taking
it at your own pace okay?
I am, I am, I gotta go.
Where are you going?
- Look at this.
- I've seen it, not a bad picture.
Christian Grey and friend.
So we're friends.
Well it must be true, if its in the paper.
- So how did it go with Dr. Greene?
- It was fine.
But she said I had to abstain from
all sexual activity for four weeks.
You know, after I start the pill.
What?
Just kidding.
I wanna take you to my playroom.
- I haven't signed the contract.
- I'm well aware. Call it a free sample.
Okay.
Ready?
Eyes down. Take off your shoes.
Arms above your head.
You have a beautiful body Anastasia.
I want you unashamed of
your nakedness, understand?
Yes sir.
Stop biting your lip, you know
what it does to me. Turn around.
When I tell you to come into this room
This is how you'll be.
You'll wait for me.
Kneeling by the door.
Hands flat on your thighs.
Good.
Hold out your hands.
- Did that hurt?
- No.
You see?
Much of your fear is in your head.
Come.
- How does that feel?
- Good.
Quiet.
Where are we going?
Remember my mother mentioned dinner?
My sister Mia's in town.
Yes.
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.
Dance with me.
Good evening Mr. Grey.
They're here!
You're here.
- Welcome welcome.
- Ana, you've met my mother.
Hi, lovely to see you.
This is my father, Carrick.
Hi, its nice to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
Is she here?
There's been a lot of speculation!
Oh my god! She exists!
Its a great apartment, and
the rent's not ridiculous.
Elliot and Jose helped us move in.
Jose is Ana's friend, although I
think Elliot's trying to poach me.
He's a cool guy!
Ana, where is your family from?
My step father's in Montesano
and my mom lives in Georgia.
- Georgia? Which part?
- Savannah.
How nice! Although I hear it gets really
humid in Georgia this time of year.
Oh my god it does.
Its stifling sometimes.
Actually I'm going to visit her tomorrow.
How nice.
You hear that Christian?
Some children do visit their
parents now and again.
- Hey dad you catch the Mariners game?
- I heard it went back stream.
This is news to me.
When were you gonna tell me?
I think it was alright though.
Who wants coffee?
Actually I promised Ana
a tour of the grounds.
Excuse us.
Christian, I cannot walk
that fast in these shoes.
When were you gonna tell me about Georgia?
What?
You have no right to be mad at me.
Yeah but I am mad.
Palm-twitchingly mad.
You're mine. All mine.
Understand?
Christian, you're so confusing.
- Ana.
- What do you want?
- What do you want?
- I want you.
I'm trying, Christian.
I know you are.
Why can't we sleep in the same bed?
Why won't you let me touch you?
Why does it have to be like this?
If you would just sign the
contract you wouldn't have...
Why do you care so much about
the contract Christian?
- Don't you like me the way I am?
- Of course I do.
- Then why are you trying to change me?
- I'm not.
- Its you.
- I need more, I want more.
Hearts and flowers?
That's not something I know.
Ana please... its you that is changing me.
Let me touch you. Let me.
- Are they burns?
- I had a rough start in life.
- That's all you need to know.
- Okay.
The woman who gave birth
to me, was a crack addict.
And a prostitute.
She died when I was four.
I remember certain things.
Terrible things.
I don't remember her.
Sometimes, I can see her in my dreams.
Do you really have to go to Georgia?
Yeah, I really.
- This gazpacho is really salty Bob.
- Yeah.
You'll get fat with all this sitting around
You tell him Ana.
- I'm not gonna tell him that.
- Yes thank you Ana.
I'm just saying gazpacho
is in a bowl of salsa.
Now could you hand me some
chips for my bowl of salsa?
You can have a carrot?
What are you getting at with this?
You're lucky that I happen
to love you... very much.
- I know that.
- Do you?
Hmm, I do.
Oh darling, I think we
should pace ourselves,
or at least order something to eat.
You go ahead, I'm not very hungry.
Oh, I just have the fruit salad.
- He can wait.
- Mom.
- Holy fuck.
- What?
What is it?
Its Christian, he's here, in Georgia.
- Here, here!
- Mrs Adams.
Delighted to meet you.
- Something to drink sir?
- Gin and tonic.
Hendrix if you have it,
otherwise Bombay Sapphire.
Cucumber with the Hendricks,
lime with Bombay.
- I like him already.
- What are you doing here Christian?
- I came to see you.
- I'm gonna step outside for a minute.
I broke rule 7, clause 5.
We'll let it go, lets not talk
about the contract right now.
How was your dinner?
She's a friend, that's all.
She knows me.
- What did she advise you to do?
- Well I'm here.
- Now what?
- I've got a room in this hotel.
Well I hope you'll be comfortable in it.
What are you doing for breakfast tomorrow?
- Where are we going?
- Its a surprise.
I think I've reached my quota of surprises.
We're almost there.
Mr Grey?
Hey, I'll be your co-pilot.
How do you do?
This is my girlfriend, Anastasia Steele.
We're at 400 feet, ready?
- Ready?
- Yes, ready.
Release.
Hold on tight.
- Is this more?
- Oh my god. So much more!
Oh my god, that was incredible Christian.
Thank you.
We aim to please Miss Steele.
- I thought you didn't do romance.
- I don't. Ana.
What? What?
Why are you fighting this?
What are you afraid of?
Grey. What? When?
Have Stefan get the plane ready.
I'll be on the tarmac in 30 minutes.
- What happened?
- I have to go back to Seattle.
Come I'll take you home.
Oh sweetheart, I wish
Christian could've stayed.
Bob was looking forward to meeting him.
I know, he had to get back to Seattle though.
There's a um, situation at work.
I wish I could tell you things
get easier, but they don't.
You just need to get to
know yourself better.
- Thank you for everything mama.
- Take care.
I will.
You think I wouldn't recognise you Taylor?
Right this way Miss Steele.
- How does he seem Taylor?
- Preoccupied I'm afraid.
- Really?
- Yes ma'am.
Well that's not gonna work.
What?
Well tell them they don't have 24 hours.
That is unacceptable.
I need to know.
Just keep me informed.
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing that concerns you.
- I can leave if you want me to go?
- No.
That's the last thing I want.
I want you, in the playroom, in 15 minutes.
- What are your safe words?
- Red and yellow.
Remember them.
That sounds so sad.
Everything you play sounds sad.
You said you were six and when you learned,
was it because you wanted
to please your new family?
I just wanna talk.
Why won't you let me in?
- We should be talking.
- Like normal people?
Yeah.
Is that so wrong?
Is this because of the contract?
Because I still haven't signed it?
Fuck the contract, I think its a
little redundant don't you?
So then the rules are redundant too?
- No. The rules stand.
- And what if I break them?
- Then there'll be consequences.
- Punishment?
Yes.
- Why do you want to punish me?
- Ana.
Why do you want to hurt me?
I would never do anything to you,
that you couldn't handle.
But why do you even wanna do anything
at all to me Christian?
If I told you, you'd never
look at me the same way again.
So there is a reason. Tell me.
- Do you wanna punish me right now?
- Yes.
I wanna punish you right now.
What if I told you that I feel the same
way about being punished as you
do about me touching you, would
you still wanna punish me then?
No. But that doesn't
mean I wouldn't need to.
- Why?
- Ana stop.
- Why do you need...
- Because its the way I am!
Because I'm 50 shades of fucked up.
Show me then.
I need you to show me,
what you wanna do to me.
Punish me, show me how bad it can be.
I want you to show me the worst.
Its the only way I can understand.
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.
Bend over.
I'm gonna hit you six times.
And you're gonna count with me.
- Count, Anastasia.
- One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Is this what you really want?
You wanna see me like this?
- Ana.
- Don't come near me.
Does this give you pleasure?
No.
Don't you dare come near me.
Please don't hate me.
You will never do that to me again.
- I'm not what you want.
- No, you are everything that I want.
I've fallen in love with you.
No. No, Ana. You can't love me.
I need you to leave.
Please.
- I'd like my car back.
- Taylor already sold it.
Then I'd like the money
he got for it please.
I'll send you a check.
Okay.
Taylor will take you home.
Stop.
No!
- Ana.
- Christian.




Listen!
Stop!
You silly fucking twit!
Please!
You are one stupid
fucking bitch, you know that?
Shut the fuck up!
No.
There you are.
No!
No.
You're a little shit.
No!
No!
Anastasia Steele?
Thanks.
Yeah. Got it.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Hyde.
Ana, please, it's Jack.
Tea, right? Weak, black.
I'm pretty sure I'm
supposed to get this for you,
but thank you, Jack.
Barbados is amazing;.
It's all coral
and turtles and booze...
Oh! You should be here.
Why aren't you here?
Yeah, and tell that
douchebag brother at mine
to take a day off for once, would ya?
All right. Bye, Ana.
Bye!
So, how's the new job'?
It's good. My boss has me
weighing in on submissions.
That's exciting. Great.
Have you heard from Christian?
Yeah.
He sent me flowers.
To wish me luck.
Sweetheart,
are you ever gonna tell me
what happened between you?
Fundamental
differences, I guess.
It wasn't gonna last.
Are those for me?
Nah. They can wait.
Okay.
Look nice.
Going out tonight?
Oh, um, a friend of mine has a
photography exhibition opening tonight.
So, gonna go.
Good.
How did you make out
with those manuscripts?
Oh, really great, actually.
This one, um...
Boyce Fox.
I couldn't put it down.
It's so sharp.
And relevant. And I think
he's really got something.
You think?
Yeah.
All right. I'll check it out.
Great.
Have fun tonight, Ana.
Thank you.
Thanks for today.
Good night, Hannah.
Bye!
Glass of chardonnay?
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ.
Ana!
You made it.
Jos...
This is, like, so much
of my face in here.
Well, if I had asked, you would
have been like, "I'm too shy."
Yeah.
But you...
It's my best stuff.
That's so.
Do you like them?
They are super large.
Hold on.
All the portraits
have sold to one man.
You're kidding!
No.
Well, somebody likes them.
They just bought all six.
All six?
Dinner's on me tonight, okay?
I'll be right back.
Anastasia.
It was you, wasn't it? You just
went and bought all of these?
I don't like strangers
gawking at you.
Why are you here?
For you.
Hey.
Can we talk somewhere private?
No.
Look, I'm not very good at this.
I've never had to...
I've never wanted to try again.
Christian, I don't...
It's not a good idea.
Let's talk.
Okay? Just talk, please.
Have dinner with me.
Okay, fine. I will have
dinner with you.
Because I'm hungry.
But we are only talking
and that is it.
Hold on.
Hey.
I'm gonna take off.
Already? Your photos
are so stunning, Jos.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm proud of you.
Christian, I can't.
I can't do this.
Christ, Ana.
Okay.
I have a proposition.
Just come to dinner.
We can talk.
Would you like some more time?
No. Two steaks' medium.
Fries. Green vegetables.
Um, actually, I'm gonna have
the quinoa salad.
Fine.
And two glasses of
the Barossa Valley Shiraz.
We only sell that
by the bottle, sir.
A bottle then.
Yes, Sir.
Thanks.
So?
Let's talk.
I want you back.
I'd like to renegotiate terms.
But I don't see how.
The things you want, you
said that's the way you are.
But what happened last time,
that's not gonna happen again.
How can you say that?
I know that I asked you
to show me how far it can go,
but you were getting off
on the pain you inflicted.
That's still in you.
I'm working on it.
Working on what?
I can't do this
if you won't talk to me.
What do you wanna know?
Everything.
Fine.
Yeah. We'll manage.
My birth mother died
when I was four.
She was an addict. Crack.
You can fill in the blanks.
Why didn't you tell me that?
I did.
But you were asleep at the time.
Okay. Well, um...
Generally,
a key part of good communication
is that both parties
be conscious.
I'm really sorry
about your mother.
It's in the past.
Now, I brought you here
to negotiate.
You're open to new terms?
No rules.
No punishments.
No rules, no punishments
and no more secrets.
I can do that.
You want a...
What do you call it?
A vanilla relationship?
I mean, we only do what
you're comfortable with.
But you need all those things.
I need you more.
Miss Steele.
Thanks, Taylor.
No strings attached.
This is spiky.
I like it.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay.
Good night.
Ana, I've been hearing a lot
of good things about you.
- Oh...
- Told you, Liz.
This one actually reads.
Hey, Jack.
What's the head of HR doing lurking around?
Are we in trouble?
Not at all.
I'm just here to encourage.
Really? Well, I think a round of
drinks at Lori's would do the trick.
Sorry. Meetings.
Otherwise.
Who's Lori?
Oh, it's a bar
around the corner.
Fridays are a bit of a ritual.
You should come.
Absolutely. Go network.
Oh, no, I would. I have plans tonight.
So have your plan come along.
Just for a quick one.
Hello?
Yeah.
Have fun.
Anastasia.
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?
It's okay.
I'm nobody.
Hey. Lori's is this way.
Come on, I'm buying.
All right. Here we go.
Mmm. Thanks.
Where is everyone?
You know, it's still early.
Your comments on Boyce Fox
were interesting.
I'm not usually
into political thrillers.
Yeah, well' I think
the parallels
with Dante's Inferno
are amazing, but...
No. You convinced me.
I'm reading.
Oh. That's great.
Hi! He!
Um, uh...
Christian, this is Jack Hyde.
I'm the boyfriend.
I'm the boss.
What will you have, Chris?
Thanks, Jack.
Another time.
Thanks.
Another time.
I can't believe you
just talked to him like that.
He wants what's mine.
What's yours?
That's a little presumptuous.
He's my boss, Christian.
You gotta calm down.
Calm isn't really my forte.
I know something that could help.
You know, this is not
what I had in mind.
When's the last time
you went shopping?
Houston. A week ago.
What'd you buy?
An airline.
Here.
Your new favorite flavor.
Excuse me.
Do you need a hand with that?
I'll manage.
Okay.
I know what you're doing.
What? I'm being
a culinary mastermind.
You only have to ask.
I think we should take it slow.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Tell me about SIP.
How's it going?
It's good.
Jack seems genuinely
interested in my opinion.
What's morale like?
Morale?
You mean, like,
do we all sit in a circle
and sing the company song in the morning?
Is the firm well managed?
Are people happy?
Oh, my God.
What?
You're buying SIP?
No! You can't do that.
That's my job.
You can't start
interfering in my career.
It's not about that
I've wanted to move into publishing.
They' re the best fit.
But you're gonna be my boss.
Technically, I'll be your
boss's boss's boss.
And I'm gonna be sleeping
with my boss's boss's boss.
Right now,
you're arguing with him.
Yeah, because he's being an ass.
An ass. Really?
Ass.
Ooh...
You know that's off limits.
I'm gonna need a road map.
I thought you wanted to
take it slow.
What do you want, Anastasia?
If we're to communicate,
you have to tell me.
I want you.
I'm too dressed.
Keep going.
Kiss me.
What do you want, Anastasia?
I want all of you.
Why do you think you waited?
For sex.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I was reading Austen and Bront
and nobody ever
measured up to that.
I guess I was waiting
for something exceptional.
And then I met you.
Would Miss Austen
approve of this?
I was being romantic,
and then you just go and distract
me with your kinky fuckery.
"Kinky fuckery"?
Mmm-hmm.
I don't know what that is,
but I like the sound of it.
You looked so peaceful.
I didn't wanna wake you.
There's not much for breakfast,
unless you want
cold stir-fry.
No.
Mmm.
Here. The check you gave me for
Wanda, you should have it back.
Keep it.
Keep it? It's $24,000.
Yeah, I know.
I make that kind of money
every 15 minutes. Keep it.
Andrea? Good morning.
Could you please transfer $24,000 into
the account of Miss Anastasia Steele?
No! What are you doing?
That's fine.
Thank you.
Why do you have
my bank account details?
What's good for breakfast
around here?
Christian, how do you
have my bank information?
Thank you.
Gotta be quicker
than that, Grey.
My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.
I promised I'd make
an appearance.
Want you to come with me.
I've never been to a ball.
I don't have a dress for that.
Also, what am I gonna
do with my hair?
I know a salon.
And you don't need to
worry about a dress.
It's all gonna be taken care of.
What is it'?
Um...
There was just a girl
over there.
And she was outside
my office yesterday.
And she knew my name.
And she had a bandage on her wrist.
It was really strange.
We should go.
Just now.
Yeah.
Keep me informed.
You know that girl, Christian?
I'm handling it.
What does that mean?
I don't want you to worry about it.
Trust me.
Um...
Hey, how are you doing?
Good, okay. So, uh,
my girlfriend's here...
Oh.
Ana.
Was that Mrs. Robinson?
Her name's Elena Lincoln.
I don't care what her
name is, Christian.
Why would you take me there?
Why would you take me to meet the
woman who seduced and abused you?
Our relationship ended years ago.
We're just friends.
And business partners.
Business partners?
Are you kidding me?
Would you take your Subs there?
Oh, my God! For what?
Her approval?
What?
What is this?
No. It's not like that.
That girl that I saw this morning
was one of them, wasn't she?
Let's discuss this
back at my place.
I can have someone
come by, do your hair.
Christian, I don't care
about my hair!
Explain to me what's going on.
I'll explain when
we're there. Come on.
Okay, you can either walk or I
can carry you. Your choice.
You wouldn't do that.
No, it's your choice.
Okay, fine. Fine.
I'll walk.
Her name's Leila Williams.
She was my Sub for a while
about two years ago.
What happened to her?
She wanted more.
I didn't.
So I ended it.
She left. Got married.
I thought she moved on, but then
her husband died in a car crash.
She had a breakdown.
What does she want now?
When you and I were in Georgia
together, she turned up here
and tried to slit her wrists in front
of Mrs. Jones, my housekeeper.
Oh, my God.
Gail took her to the hospital,
but by the time I got there,
she'd taken off.
My people have been
trying to find her.
Your people?
Is that who put this together?
Is there one on me?
Let me see it.
"Subject works part time at
Clayton's Hardware, Richmond Road."
You know, they didn't time
my bathroom breaks.
You should probably
get your money back.
I had them drawn up on any
prospective Submissive.
Nice. Jesus.
I had no idea what
this was gonna become.
I didn't know
you'd be different.
Different? Really?
Is that why you brought me
to Mrs. Robinson's,
where you brought all the other women?
Because I'm so different?
That was wrong. I admit.
It's all wrong.
All of this is wrong.
You put money into my account that...
I don't want it.
You bought the company
I work for.
This isn't a relationship,
Christian. It's ownership.
I'm trying to understand you.
I am just wanting to
get close to you.
But it's really difficult to
do that when you keep doing
bizarre things like this.
And it's really difficult to do that
when you won't let me touch you.
Come to my bedroom.
Sex is not gonna fix this
right now. Are you insane?
Ana, please.
You wanted a road map?
Start here.
Those are my boundaries.
I can live with that.
Then I'm all yours.
Mr. Grey,
your appointment's arrived,
Okay. Send him
into Ana's room.
He's here.
Who's here?
Wow.
Hair up, I think. Yes?
Your neck is beautiful.
Christian'?
Ciao, Bella.
You're just gonna
stand there gawking?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I might.
So I was thinking
tonight might be
more stimulating
if you wear these.
How am I supposed to wear those?
Well,
you have to get them wet first.
Curious?
Mmm-hmm.
Okay.
Open your mouth.
Good.
Now turn. Bend over.
No, you're not putting
those in my butt.
They don't go in your butt.
Stay still.
Stand up straight
and turn around.
How's it feel?
Mmm...
Weird.
But good.
What do they do?
You'll find oui.
Wear the silver satin.
It'll go well with these.
Don't worry. They're for your ears.
Did I mention it was
a masked ball?
No.
Your new bodyguards
need to wear these, too?
I'm just being safe.
You won't even notice
they're here.
Come on.
The way you wear your hat.
The way you sip your tea.
The memory of alt that.
No, no, they can't take that
away from me.
The way your smile just beams.
The way you sing off-key.
Everybody's looking at us.
Not us. You.
Christian! I'm so glad you made it.
Mother.
"Mother" is so formal.
Honestly.
Ana.
Hi.
How you doing?
These things are beautiful,
and they are mysterious,
but they're a pain in the ass.
You look spectacular.
Thank you. So do you.
This dress is so beautiful.
Thank you, Ana.
I'm so glad you're back
with Christian.
He was lost without you.
Oh. Can I have my
date back, please?
By all means. Spoilsport.
See you later.
No, no, they can't take that
away from me
Ana! My God!
That dress, it should be illegal.
Monique Lhuillier.
Yeah. Mia.
Mia, you know
I barely recognized you.
Yeah! The new me.
Okay, what do you think?
Well, it's very, uh, blonde.
How do you put up with him?
Do you know he was an even
bigger pain as a teenager?
He got expelled from four
different schools for brawling.
That's enough. Yeah,
totally out of control.
- Mia, enough.
- Mia?
I'll be right back.
Hi! How are you?
Hmm?
Ana?
You will be sitting here, darling.
Right next to Cary.
Christian, you over here.
Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, to our annual ball.
As you know,
proceeds from this evening
will go to the charity that Grace
and I founded so many years ago...
Coping Together.
Working to make fife better for
the children...
of parents addicted to drugs.
Everything okay?
And now, thankfully,
I will be handing off
my speaking duties
to our master of ceremonies,
Mr. Nomad Paul.
Thank you, Mr. Grey, and
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Hungry?
Let's start the bidding
with lot number one.
Ravenous.
- Do I hear $10, 000?
- Ten!
Now you know what those
silver balls do.
$15,000.
$15,000.
Going once, going twice...
Said!
That's a great start, ladies and gentlemen.
New, lot number two,
a week's vacation at' a luxury
chalet in Aspen, Colorado,
donated by
Mr. Christian Grey.
Mmm.
Let's start the bidding off
at $10, 000.
$10,000!
Thank you, ma'am. $10,000.
I didn't know
you had a place in Aspen.
I have a lot of places.
Boy, we have some ski
lovers in the room tonight.
$17,000!
$17,000. Thank you, sir. 18?
$18,000.
$18,000.
Thank you. Do I hear 19? 19?
$19,000. Thank you, sir.
A week of luxury in
America's finest ski resort.
$24,000.
New blood! $24, 000 I am bid.
Do I hear $25,000'?
That money was for you.
And now it'll go to
someone who needs it.
I don't know whether to worship
at your feet or spank you.
$24,000.
Going once...
I think...
Going twice...
I'll take option two.
Sold! To the young lady
in silver.
Your generosity realty makes a
difference, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's go.
You want this?
I want you to spank me.
Hands.
If it gets too much, you have
to tell me to stop, understood?
Yes.
Hold still.
I want you to come, Ana.
Come for me.
Is this your room?
Once upon a time.
Who's this?
Is that your mother?
You know you can just say you
don't wanna talk about it.
Yeah, I don't wanna
talk about it.
Let's go.
They'll be missing us.
Uh, I just need a minute.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Okay.
Don't forget your mask.
Under my skin.
I'd sacrifice anything
come what might.
For the sake of having you near.
What?
Nothing.
Comes in the night And repeats
and repeats in my ear.
Don't you know, little fool
You never can win
Christian has a date.
I'm impressed.
I'm sorry.
Elena.
I wanted to meet you.
I can't say the same.
Excuse me.
Hey, I'm not the enemy.
I know what you did
to Christian.
All I did was lead him to the
truth of who he really is.
Without me, he'd be
in jail or dead.
And he would say the same.
I'm not listening to this.
Do you think you're the first
woman he'd hoped would save him?
He needs a Submissive in life.
Not just in the bedroom.
No, he's changing that.
It's not what he wants anymore.
But it's what he needs.
And you don't strike me as the type
of woman who wants to be owned.
If you really wanna make him
happy, if you wanna be happy,
you'll let him go.
There's no way that someone like you
could ever understand what we have.
I've been there.
Nothing lasts.
Nothing.
Whatever happens
between me and Christian
is none of your
goddamn business.
So you stay the fuck
away from us.
Hey, we should
think about going soon.
I wanna go now.
What did Elena say to you'?
Nothing I didn't already know.
Will you just take me
to my house?
Stay with me tonight.
Hey, wake up.
We're home. Hmm.
Sir?
Stay here.
We'll have the car towed.
What happened?
That's my car!
What happened to my car?
Check the apartment.
Call me when it's safe.
Yes, sir. Right away.
Copy that
Smith, you stick
with Mr. Grey.
Where are we going?
Christian'?
Do you think it was Leila?
You really think she would
do something like that?
I really don't see why we can't
just go back to your apartment.
That place is like a fortress.
There's no way she could
have gotten in there.
She shouldn't have been able to
get into the garage, either.
I'm not taking any chances.
Good evening, Mr. Grey.
Hey, Ed.
The rest of the crew
will be here in the morning.
If something were to happen
to you because of me...
It won't.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Can I wash this off?
Don't stray from the lines.
Okay.
Are these burns?
Who did this to you?
Go on, it's over.
I know how difficult it is
for you to open up to me
and tell me these things.
But it means the world to me.
It means you love me.
Yes, I do.
So this is where your knot-tying
expertise comes from.
Good morning.
Sleep well?
I did.
This boat is really beautiful.
This is from my yard in Seattle.
You built it?
I had some help.
It's called The Grace.
After your mom?
You sound surprised.
Well, you're always
so cool towards her.
I owe everything to Grace.
She saved my life
after my birth mom died.
Do you remember your birth mom?
I try not to.
What happened to her?
She overdosed.
They found her body
three days later.
Where were you?
I was with her.
Oh, my God.
Took her away.
Took me to a hospital.
Grace was there.
Thank you for telling me.
Look at that house.
That's beautiful.
The view's probably amazing.
I wonder who lives there.
It's an old sea widow.
Lost her husband years ago.
Sits at the window every night
waiting for him to come home.
Did you just make that up?
Yeah.
You wanna take the helm?
Me?
Yeah, you. Come on.
I can't do that.
See where I'm looking'?
Yeah.
Right there. Just hold.
Okay?
Okay.
No, you're fine, Ana.
I'm still here.
Don't let go.
I have to let go.
Don't.
Oh, my God. Okay.
Okay?
You ready?
Okay.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I'm steering it.
I'm doing it.
I'm the captain.
Oh, my God!
Hey.
Hey, Jack.
Personal calls on your
own time, okay?
Yeah?
Um, did you get my message?
You had a phone call this morning
with Ruth Carusi at 9:00 a.m.
Shit.
Loan just reschedule it.
I'll ask them.
Did you book our rooms
for New York yet?
Sorry?
New York. Book expo. This Friday.
It's in the diary.
No, yeah, I know. Yeah, I
booked your room. Of course.
And you.
It's expected that
my assistant also attends.
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
Just get yourself a room.
Unless you'd rather stay
back with your boyfriend.
I mean, ifs not like
you need to work.
I'll sort it out.
Eric, hey. It's Jack.
How was your weekend?
No shit.
Mine was great.
It was fantastic.
Yeah, 'cause I read
your new pages.
No, they're amazing.
Amazing.
No, I couldn't put it down.
We'll be accessing state and
federal grants of course,
but more than 70% of the funding...
will come directly from
Grey Enterprises Holdings.
We'll be making cutting edge
renewable energy tech
that will more than
repay our investment.
Provides a solid consumer base.
For our products.
We're aware that
you have other bidders
and some of them may offer what
look like better terms, but...
Hello?
Christian'?
Oh, my God!
Oh, excuse me, Miss Steele,
I didn't mean to startle you.
No, no.
You are very quiet.
I'm Mrs. Jones. Mr. Grey's
housekeeper. May I?
Oh, um...
Sure. Thank you.
Um, I'm Ana.
But you knew that already
because you said my last name.
Mr. Grey is in his study,
just finishing up a call.
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me. Okay.
See anything you like?
Oh, fuck.
The door was, um, unlocked.
I'll have to talk to
Mrs. Jones.
Does she come in here a lot?
Does she dust in here?
Those are nipple clamps.
Come here.
Give me your hand.
It's even more intense
when you take them off.
Ow.
What's this?
Okay.
That's enough show-and-tell.
What's this?
Let's learn to walk
before we run.
I kinda like running.
Ana?
Mmm-hmm?
Last time we did this,
you saw another side of me.
And you left.
Last time was different.
All right. But not here.
Mrs. Jones.
Oh, my God.
You're mine.
I'm yours.
You okay?
Yeah.
You know at some point we're
gonna need to talk about New York.
We have talked about it.
You forbidding it is
not us talking about it.
If you wanna go to New
York, don't go with Hyde.
Let me take you.
I have a place there.
Of course you do.
This isn't
some sort of vacation.
It's a work trip with my boss,
who I would like to impress.
You know he's had three
assistants in the last 18 months,
all of whom have quit
without notice?
You don't think
I can handle him?
That's not il.
That's what it feels like.
Ana, I know full well
that you can handle anything.
And, uh, if you really wanna go,
then I can't stop you.
But I'd like to
take you there myself.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
I mean, of course I would
rather see New York with you.
Good.
I hate it when we fight.
That wasn't a fight.
That was a conversation.
It was, you know, when somebody
talks, and the other person listens,
and you resolve an issue.
That's how it works.
It's crazy, isn't it?
Night, Ana.
Good night, Hannah.
You leaving?
Um, I was actually just about to come
talk to you. Uh, about New York.
There a problem?
Um...
I'm so grateful
for the opportunity, Jack,
but with such short notice,
I made plans
that I can't change.
Huh.
But I will have my phone
on me all weekend.
So if you need anything,
I'm available.
Ana, have a seat.
I'm really... I'm sorry.
I think you have
tremendous potential here.
But I don't wanna waste my time
training someone who doesn't
take this position seriously.
I do.
This is my dream job.
Then shouldn't going to New York and
the book expo be part of that dream?
It is.
It is.
It was just a misunderstanding.
It won't happen again.
Because there are plenty of qualified
people who would kill for this job.
I mean, look, I don't wanna brag,
but I'm a pretty great teacher.
I'm sure you are.
I'm just not seeing the
initiative on your side of it.
I've read more than
you've asked me to.
And I'm on top of everything...
I'm talking about
going the extra mile.
Unless you want me
to compete with Christian Grey
for your attention.
I apologize that Christian was so
curt with you the other night.
Is that what this is about?
Your boyfriend has
a reputation for being
a little ruthless.
Is that what you like?
If you have a problem with my work,
then you should take it up with HR.
Whoa.
Why are you being so serious?
What do you think I'm gonna do'?
Make you fuck me?
Jack.
I just think...
I just think
if you're gonna fuck
your way to prominence,
then you should do it with someone
who can at least make you smarter.
Not just richer.
Right?
Don't...
Don't what'? Hmm?
Look, this is a serious,
serious question.
Do you wanna be kept
or taken seriously?
Hmm?
I would like to leave,
please, Jack.
Plus...
I can make you come
like nobody else has.
Not him.
Not anyone.
No.
Ana?
Ana, what happened?
Jack Hyde tried to touch me.
I'll kill him.
No, no, please don't go.
Don't go. Don't leave me.
Okay. Go.
It's okay. Hey...
I left everything. I don't
have any of my stuff.
Taylor will get it.
It's fine, okay?
I'll take you home, come on.
And his pass has been cancelled?
Good.
No. Thank you, Jerry.
Good night.
Well, at least
that's dealt with.
Hyde's out.
He's been fired.
Whoa.
How? That's...
But I thought your deal with
SIP hasn't been finished yet.
It's not.
But I know the CEO.
I told him what happened.
You'll never have to
see him again.
Am I still gonna have a job
now that he's not there?
Well, if you don't,
you can just...
Christian, you know
I love working.
You can't keep me locked up
in your penthouse.
What if I gave you a key?
I mean,
what if you had a key, and you
kept some of your stuff here?
Keep all of your stuff here
and you slept, you know...
Not at your place.
Are you asking me
to move in with you?
Mmm-hmm.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I want you here all the time.
As soon as possible.
What happened to learning
to walk before we run?
That's just one of the many things that
we could talk about over breakfast.
Can I think about it?
Sure.
Yeah.
Liz, hi!
Ana, don't know if you heard,
but Jack resigned last night.
In kind of a hurry.
SIP isn't recruiting
right now, so we're screwed.
So you don't need me
anymore then?
I'm gonna try to find you
something temporary.
Could you fill in for Jack
at this morning's meeting?
At the senior editors' meeting?
Just for today.
You're the only one
who knows Jack's entire slate.
Well, yeah, but, I...
You're right.
It's too much.
No, I can do it.
It's fine. I can do it.
Great.
Call me when you're done.
We need to print fewer titles.
Stick with established authors.
Focus on our core readership.
Expand it.
I'm sorry.
Um, uh... So, Ana, what do you
think we should be publishing?
Um, newer voices.
Along with your established authors.
Mmm-hmm.
Boyce Fox, for example,
got 80,000 hits last week.
Really?
Online hits don't automatically
translate to print sales.
Well, but they could.
His online audience
is an 1840-24 demographic,
and those are exactly the readers
that we should be chasing.
Urn, I mean, lean show you the stats.
I think he's worth taking a risk on.
Maybe we should take a look.
Great idea.
Uh, Ana? Ana, just...
Mr. Roach, I'm really sorry
if I was out of line.
No, don't be sorry.
You made a lot of sense.
No, so, uh, what are you doing
now that Jack Hyde's gone?
Um, well, Liz mentioned something
temporary. I don't know.
Okay. So why don't you
fill in for Jack temporarily?
Good?
Um...
Great. Okay.
That's settled.
To SIP's new fiction editor.
Acting fiction editor.
Till they find out
how good you are.
Christian, did you have
something to do with this?
No. Hey, it was all you.
What? You don't
believe me?
I don't believe it myself.
I asked you a question
last night.
About moving in with you?
Mmm-hmm.
I just think that
I'm probably...
I need to get some things
from my apartment.
That can be arranged.
Good.
Now, maybe we could
take this celebration home.
The check, please.
Take off your panties.
Do it now.
Right in here?
Yeah, right here. Now.
Go on.
Hmm.
Excuse me.
Don't come.
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No.
Two minutes.
Are you kidding?
In the bedroom.
Are you joking?
Two minutes.
What are you doing in here?
You made me wait,
so now it's your turn.
Are you any good?
Hmm. We'll see.
Maybe we should make a bet.
If I win,
you take me to the red room.
And if I win?
Your choice.
Break.
Okay.
Mmm. Solids.
Oh, dear.
Side pocket.
Red room, here we come.
Oof.
Shit.
I hope you're not a sore loser.
That depends on
how hard you spank me.
I want to be
very rough with you.
So be rough with me.
And Jada needs someone
to sign off on the new Carusi.
I kept asking Jack to do that.
Yeah, well, Jack was
kind of lazy.
Didn't you notice?
Yeah.
I believe he called it
"artistic: Temperament."
Thank you, Hannah.
Yep.
Hey.
It's great that
you're doing this, but...
It's totally weird,
I know. I know.
I mean, am I expected
to call you Miss Steele?
I expect you to call me Ana.
And I don't expect you
to fetch me coffee
unless you're getting
some for yourself.
And the rest of it, we'll
just make up as we go, okay?
Okay.
Miss Steele.
Damn it.
Take it. I'm just gonna grab
some stuff and check the mail.
I should go up with you.
No, it's okay.
I'll be two seconds.
Take it.
Hey, Ros.
Leila.
Christian is downstairs.
Do you wanna see him?
I came to see you.
Okay.
He told me what happened.
I know you're in a lot of pain.
I'm so sorry.
He lets you call him
by his name.
He talks about you all the time.
He cares about you.
Don't lie.
Tell me what you have
that I don't.
Nothing.
I'm nothing.
He'll get tired of me.
Master sleeps in your bed.
How do you know that?
I saw you.
I watched you.
I know you love him.
I do, too.
We all do.
Why don't you put the gun down?
You don't know him
or what he likes.
You don't give him what he wants.
He's pretending with you.
No, Christian.
Kneel.
Ana...
Go to Escala.
Wait for me there.
For once, just do
as you're told.
Taylor, get her out of here.
Miss Steele.
Miss Steele. Ana!
Stop it, Taylor.
I don't care.
She's been gone for three hours, and she
doesn't have her cell or her purse.
Forget it. She's here.
Where the fuck have you been?
I told you to come
straight here.
I've had people out combing
the streets, looking for you.
I'm sorry I don't always
do as I'm told.
Maybe you just really need
someone who obeys every command.
Don't be ridiculous.
I saw you, Christian.
I saw the way
you were with Leila.
She had a gun, Ana.
I would have done
anything to subdue her.
Where is she now?
Is she here?
What?
No, of course not.
She's in the psych ward getting
the help that she needs.
Look, I know she scared you...
Yeah. She scared me.
But you scared me more.
Seeing you like that with her'
I'll never be able to give you that
kind of submission and obedience.
Ana.
Don't crowd me.
I need space.
No, please don't do this.
Christian.
Don't give up on me. I just
need to think a little bit.
Don't leave me.
What are you doing?
Get up.
What are you doing?
Look at me.
Look at me.
I'm scared.
I know you say that I'm enough.
But there are certain things
that you are used to getting
that I will never, ever,
ever be able to give you.
And it might be fine
for right now,
but what's gonna happen when
you start needing them again?
I won't.
How do you know that?
How can I believe you?
I don't even understand
your need to dominate.
I'm not a Dominant.
I'm not.
The right term is a sadist.
I get off on punishing women.
Women who look like you...
Like your mother.
Yes.
And I know
how fucked up that is.
When you left,
I swore that I would stop it if
that's what it took to get you back.
But I'm done with it.
You mean more to me
than anything else.
I wanna
believe you. I do.
But I can't.
Ana, give me your hand.
This is me.
All of me.
Christian.
And I'm all yours.
No.
No!
Hey. Hey, hey.
No.
It's okay.
I'm right here.
I'm right here.
Marry me.
What?
I want you to marry me.
Christian, I think
you're dreaming.
Good morning.
Morning.
Sleep okay?
I did. You?
Like a log.
Out all night.
Hmm.
You didn't have any
weird dreams or anything?
Or, like, wake up at all?
No.
I mean,
none that I can think of.
Hmm.
I mean, there was a little thing
of asking you to marry me,
but aside from that, no.
Nothing.
Don't mess with me like that.
No? How should I
mess with you?
Like this? Huh?
Is that better?
I meant it.
I wanna marry you.
Why?
Because I wanna spend every second
of the rest of my life with you.
I don't expect you
to say yes right away.
I know I'm complicated.
Just a little bit.
You have an assistant?
I thought you were an assistant.
It's a long story.
What's going on?
What do I get Christian
for his birthday?
The boy already has everything
except a sense of humor.
Uh...
His birthday?
When is his birthday?
Sunday. He didn't tell you?
He is so weird.
Mom and Dad
are throwing him a party.
Didn't they just have a party?
Jeez, you're as bad as he is.
That was a ball.
This is just family, friends,
music, fireworks.
No biggie.
Hey, what about a tie?
Uh, uh...
Christian has a lot of ties.
Socks, suspenders? Throw me a bone here?
Um, oh...
God, Mia, I gotta go.
Okay, okay. But Sunday, or I'll
hunt you down myself. Bye.
Ooh, perfect.
Do you have a gift box?
One second.
Hey.
Miss Steele.
Hmm.
How was your day?
Looking up, Mr. Grey.
Where's Taylor?
He went to get my bag.
Your bag?
Where are you going?
Ros and I have to go to
Portland for some meetings.
I'll be back tomorrow night.
Come on.
When were you going to tell
me about your birthday?
Your parents are
throwing you a party.
Were we just gonna stay home?
They do this every year.
Um, yeah. Birthday.
My, uh, arrival in the world isn't
something I feel like celebrating.
Well, I feel like
celebrating it.
Can't open it
till the day though.
Then why give it to me now?
Cali it delayed gratification.
Is that...
ls that Mount St. Helens?
I changed the flight plan,
get us home sooner.
Great. You realize
that's a volcano, right?
Relax, Ros. If it goes up,
you'll have a ringside seat.
Ah.
Lucky me.
Christian, what is that?
Don't worry.
Oh, my God! Christian!
Shit.
Shit. Christian,
what is going on?
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
What is happening?
Damn it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Christian!
Stop it!
Christian!
There.
There, there, there, there!
Oh, you remember this guy?
Kate!
Hi!
Oh, my God!
You're so tan and glowy.
You want a beer, Ana?
Yes! Please. Please.
Hi, Jos.
Hey.
Hi! How's it going?
So? Congratulations,
Fiction Editor.
Right?
She's a big deal now.
And how's, uh, your hottie?
Uh, Christian is good.
Um, uh...
He asked me to move in with him.
What?
Ana's moving in with Christian.
Oh, that's great.
You know, we could
use the privacy.
He's so subtle, it kills me.
Stop.
So you're serious. But are you happy?
'Cause that's all I care about.
I mean, it's complicated,
but I've never been happier.
Hey, Mia, what's up?
Did you hear about Jos's show?
It was incredible.
Really. He was amazing.
He got rave reviews.
I gotta check it oui.
Wait, wait, Mia.
Slow down.
Shit. Okay. Yeah, yeah,
we're on our way.
Um, Christian's chopper went missing
on the way back from Portland.
They're sending out
search parties right now.
Come on, let's go.
For more on this breaking
story, Rat's go out to the field
and our reporter, Rachel Taylor.
Rachel'!
Thank you, John.
I'm speaking to you five from the private
helicopter terminal at Seattle...
They'll find him. He'll be okay.
It's Christian.
The helicopter was
an Airbus helicopter H-130.,.
Is there anything we can do?
And Christian Grey,
although only 27 years old,
had extensive flying experience.
All right' bye.
One of Seattle's youngest
billionaires,
Grey's the charismatic head
of Grey Enterprises Holdings,
a multinational
conglomerate....
Jesus! Will someone
shut them up?
No, please. Leave it on.
Just turn it down please, Jos.
Thank you.
You're shivering. I'll
get you a sweater, okay?
Ana. Tea.
He's gonna be fine.
He has to be okay.
We haven't had any time.
We need to have more time.
You're going to have
plenty of time.
We're so glad that
you're here with us
and in Christian's life.
You've made such
a difference to him.
He never let anyone get
close until you came along.
Grace, he adores you.
I know,
but children grow apart from
their parents, and that's fine,
as long as they're happy.
And he is happy with you.
And that's all I ever wanted.
Turn it up.
Christian Grey and his colleague
Ros Bailey have been found safe and wen'
and are, at this moment,
on their way back in Seattle.
What the hell
are you all doing here?
Christian?
Oh, my God!
Christian!
How did you get here?
Later, Mia.
What happened? Oh, my God!
Why didn't you call?
I had an accident.
I lost my phone.
We know.
It's been all over the news.
I'm fine.
Ros is fine.
Dad, he's here.
He just walked in.
I'm okay. He looks like shit,
but he's in one piece.
- No, he doesn't.
- Yeah, he does.
Guys, relax. I'm fine.
Come here, man.
Okay. Need to say hi to my girl.
Come on, Mom.
- I need a drink.
- Me, too.
Miss me?
Oh, my God.
I thought...
Hey, hey, Ana...
It's all right.
Ana, I'm here.
I was so scared.
I was so scared.
I thought I lost you forever.
Not a chance.
I'm here.
That's when
all my instruments lit up.
- Had a fire in the tail, lost both engines.
- Both of them?
Yeah. Thank you.
I tried to find somewhere safe
to land, but it was all trees.
We hit them pretty hard, but luckily we
were both able to crawl out of there.
Thank goodness.
Thank God.
Sorry, guys, but
I gotta take off.
Okay.
Jos, thanks for being here.
Means the world to Ana.
Of course.
Hey...
Welcome home, Mr. Grey.
Christian, please.
Well, it's late, and these
two should get some rest.
Grace, shall we'?
Yes.
Yeah, I think we're gonna
head home too, bro.
Cool.
We'll walk you guy's.
Kinda hate to say this, but your guy's
all right.
I'm glad he's okay,
and I'm glad you're happy.
Thank you. Will we be seeing
you tomorrow at his party?
Don't push it.
Come here.
Careful.
I know.
Mom.
Okay.
We'll see you tomorrow, Ana.
Good night.
It's after midnight.
I'm not tired.
No.
It's your birthday.
Yeah.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Do you still have
that gift I gave you?
Yes.
You know you didn't have to.
All I want is you.
Just open it.
Okay.
Keychain.
Turn it over.
Does this mean yes, yes?
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Wait!
So this whole time I had
the answer in my pocket?
Anastasia Steele...
What am I gonna do with you?
Take me to the red room.
Take me...
Take me to the red room.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Yes.
I love you.
Well, I love you.
Hello?
Mom? Hi.
Ana, sweetheart.
Where have you been?
I know. I've been... I'm sorry.
Work has been so crazy.
I hope they're not
overworking you?
No, no. It's actually...
It's going really well.
Urn, but I was calling because I, um... I
wanted to talk to you about Christian.
Christian?
You've heard from him?
Yeah. We got back together.
Honey, that's wonderful! This time
it's going to last. I know it is.
I hope you're right,
because, urn...
He asked me to marry him,
and I said yes.
Mom?
You're not...
No, no, I'm not pregnant.
Um...
I know that we haven't
been together very long,
but I love him so much.
He's the one.
Oh, sweetheart!
I'm so happy for you!
You are?
Of course.
You've always
known your own mind.
If that man is the love of your
life, you grab him with both hands.
Thanks, Mama.
Have you called Ray?
Um, no, not yet.
Um... Christian did, though.
He asked for his permission.
He asked for your hand?
That's so chivalrous.
Hey.
Hey.
Champagne, Mr. Grey?
Thanks, Gretchen.
And can I just say,
happy birthday?
Sure. Thank you.
Christian.
Mom.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
And Ana.
Hi.
It's so good to see you again.
You saw us last night.
Yes.
And because of that
lam never taking anything for granted.
Ever again.
Hey!
I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?
I'm fine, Elena.
Thank you.
Oh!
Ana, let me introduce to you,
my good friend, Elena Lincoln.
We met at the masquerade.
Yes.
Nice to see you again.
Excuse us.
Surely.
She's fantastic.
Ladies, gentlemen. Mia.
I wanna thank you all
for coming here this evening.
I was expecting
a small family gathering.
Thanks, Mia.
But I'm happy
that you're all here
because I have
an announcement to make.
As most of you know, yesterday
Ros and I had a narrow escape.
And something like that reminds
us of what really matters
and how important it is
to seize the day.
We should cherish the people we
care about and who care about us.
Mom, Dad, I know I haven't
always been the perfect son.
But I owe everything
to you both, so thank you.
But that's not the announcement.
Ana, come up here
a second, please.
So, a while ago, I was lucky enough
to meet this amazing young woman,
Anastasia Steele.
And very quickly, I realized
that she was the one
I wanted to share my life with.
So I asked her to marry
me, and she said yes.
Oh! That is so...
lam thrilled, Ana.
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.
If I cry any more, I'm
just going to dehydrate.
Oh, my God!
Don't do that.
Congratulations.
Stop crying, Mom.
Can't help it.
I love you so much.
I love you.
Hi! Well done,
big brother!
Ring! Show me the ring.
Oh, we're gonna
choose it together.
No rock.
Christian Grey.
Oh, my God!
I have a sister!
I leave you alone for a couple
weeks, and this is what happens?
I know! I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.
Oh, please. Come here.
Oh!
So, how does it feel to bag
Seattle's most eligible bachelor?
It's a little scary, but...
Well, if anyone can
make it work, it's you.
Hey, sis-in-law!
Congratulations. Christian's
a very lucky guy.
You, however, are certifiably insane.
I'm sorry to interrupt
Mia wants to taste one of
your killer cocktails.
Oh, well, coming right up.
I see you heeded
our little talk.
What makes you think
I would ever listen to you?
You don't care about Christian.
He'll see that.
I'll make sure of it.
He'll see right through you.
It's over for you, Elena.
You're just a mousy little
thing after his money.
He's not capable of marriage.
Thank you, Christian.
Why are you even here, Elena?
She's not right for you.
You don't know
what's right for me.
You taught me
how to fuck, Elena.
Ana taught me how to love.
She's just the next one in line.
Get out of my house.
Leave my children alone, and
get the hell out of my house.
Ana, darling...
Would you give us
a moment alone' please?
I'm sorry about that
ls your mom okay?
Furious.
Hmm.
Elena's gone.
Like, gone, gone?
I'm done.
The business. Everything.
I'll have my people sort
out the details tomorrow.
I know she was important to you.
I'm sorry.
Are you?
No.
No.
What's that you got there?
Come with me. There's
something I need to show you.
Last time we came down here,
I was over your shoulder.
Oh, yeah.
After you.
Oh, my God!
You wanted hearts and flowers.
Oh, my God!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Christian.
This is amazing.
Be mine.
Share my life with me.
Yes.
Marry me.
I'll marry you.
Give me your hand.
Did you do that?
Great, isn't it'?
That's so pretty.
Oh!
I solemnly vow
to love you faithfully
and to keep you safe for as
long as we both snail live.
